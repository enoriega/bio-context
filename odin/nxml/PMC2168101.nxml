GST-PTP-SL or -STEP fusion proteins, were incubated in vitro with cPKA in the presence of &#x003b3;-[<sup>32</sup>P]ATP, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown, a strong phosphorylation of the PTP-SL and STEP fusion proteins was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> A, lanes 2&#x02013;4), whereas no phosphorylation took place with GST alone or a GST fusion protein containing a nonrelated PTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> A, lanes 1 and 5), indicating that PTP-SL and STEP are substrates of PKA. Substitution by alanine of the Ser<sup>231</sup> residue (S231A mutant), abolished the phosphorylation of PTP-SL by cPKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> A, lanes 8 and 10), demonstrating that this residue is the target of the kinase. Next, the in vivo phosphorylation of PTP-SL upon PKA activation conditions was investigated. Phosphorus 32 labeling was carried out on COS-7 cells transfected with plasmids encoding transmembrane (PTP-SL 1-549) or nontransmembrane (PTP-SL 147-549) PTP-SL isoforms, followed by treatment with PKA activators and immunoprecipitation with anti&#x02013;PTP-SL antibody. Incubation in the presence of the cAMP analogous dibutyryl-cAMP or the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin increased the phosphorylation of wild-type PTP-SL isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> B, lanes 3, 4, and 8), but not of the S231A mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> B, lanes 6 and 10).

Furthermore, cell treatment with the PP2A serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid (1 &#x003bc;M), induced the hyperphosphorylation of wild-type PTP-SL, but not of the S231A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> B, lanes 11&#x02013;14). These results demonstrate that the Ser<sup>231</sup> residue of PTP-SL is a substrate of PKA, and suggest a role for PP2A in the in vivo dephosphorylation of such a residue.</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphorylation of the KIM of PTP-SL by PKA Inhibits the Association and the Tyrosine Dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38&#x003b1;</title><p>Next, the effect of PTP-SL phosphorylation by PKA on its association with MAP kinases was analyzed. GST-PTP-SL fusion proteins were phosphorylated in vitro by cPKA as above, in the presence of cold ATP, and the fusion proteins were incubated with Rat-1 cell lysates and precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the presence of the MAP kinases ERK1/2 or p38&#x003b1; was detected by immunoblot using specific antibodies. Remarkably, the phosphorylation of GST-PTP-SL wild type by cPKA abrogated its association with both ERK1/2 and p38&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A, lane 2)&#x0003b; however, no changes were observed with the GST-PTP-SL S231A mutant upon incubation with cPKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A, lanes 4 and 5). To test the effect of PTP-SL phosphorylation by PKA on the association with the MAP kinases in vivo, GST-PTP-SL fusion proteins were overexpressed in 293 cells and precipitated in one-step with glutathione-Sepharose, followed by immunoblot analysis, as above. Treatment of cells with dibutyryl-cAMP or forskolin resulted in the lack of coprecipitation of ERK1/2 or HA-p38&#x003b1; with PTP-SL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> B, lanes 2 and 3)&#x0003b; however, in dibutyryl-cAMP&#x02013;treated cells that were preincubated with the PKA inhibitor H89, normal levels of association with the kinases were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> B, lane 4). Finally, the coprecipitation of ERK1/2 and p38&#x003b1; with the PTP-SL S231E mutant, which mimics a phosphorylated Ser<sup>231</sup> residue, was also tested. As shown, these MAP kinases did not associate in 293 cells with overexpressed GST-PTP-SL S231E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> C, lane 5), whereas association was efficiently detected with the GST-PTP-SL wild type, the S231A mutant or the C480S catalytically inactive mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> C, lanes 3, 4, and 6). The functional consequences of the phosphorylation of the Ser<sup>231</sup> residue of PTP-SL, on the dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38&#x003b1; by the phosphatase, were analyzed using the S231E PTP-SL mutant. GST-PTP-SL wild type or S231E fusion proteins were mixed with pellets containing activated HA-ERK2 or HA-p38&#x003b1;, and phosphatase assays were carried out, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot with the anti&#x02013;phosphotyrosine 4G10 mAb. As shown, the tyrosine dephosphorylation of HA-ERK2 and HA-p38&#x003b1; by GST-PTP-SL S231E mutant was impaired compared with that shown by GST-PTP-SL wild type, whereas equal activities of both fusion proteins were measured towards the nonspecific p-NPP substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> D and data not shown). These findings demonstrate that phosphorylation of the Ser<sup>231</sup> residue of PTP-SL by PKA inhibits its association with ERK1/2 and p38&#x003b1;, and the subsequent tyrosine dephosphorylation of these MAP kinases.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear Translocation of ERK2 and p38&#x003b1;, in the Presence of PTP-SL, Is Favored upon Activation of PKA</title><p>PTP-SL retains ERK2 in the cytoplasm in a KIM-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x58145c0N0x50ff710">Z&#x000fa;&#x000f1;iga et al. 1999</xref>). To study the effect of phosphorylation of PTP-SL by PKA on its ability to retain MAP kinases outside of the nucleus, immunofluorescence analysis was performed on COS-7 cells cotransfected with HA-ERK2 or HA-p38&#x003b1;, and PTP-SL. Overexpression of HA-ERK2 or HA-p38&#x003b1; alone resulted in their accumulation in the nucleus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A&#x0003b; and data not shown)&#x0003b; however, in the presence of PTP-SL, the nuclear accumulation of these kinases was abolished, colocalizing with the phosphatase outside of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A). Interestingly, neither the PTP activity nor the PTP domain of PTP-SL itself was required to retain HA-ERK2 outside of the nucleus, as observed by coexpression with PTP-SL catalytically inactive mutants (C480S or R486M) or with truncated PTP-SL forms lacking the PTP domain (PTP-SL 1-288) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A). On the other hand, upon coexpression with the PTP-SL S231E mutant, the cytoplasmic retention of HA-ERK2 or HA-p38&#x003b1; was significantly reduced, as compared with wild-type PTP-SL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. C</xref>). Also, when cells coexpressing wild-type PTP-SL and HA-ERK2 or HA-p38&#x003b1; were treated with dibutyryl-cAMP, the nuclear localization of both MAP kinases was partially restored, and such an effect was prevented by cell preincubation with H89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. C</xref>). However, no effect was observed upon cell treatment with agents that activate other kinase pathways, such as EGF or PMA (data not shown). Furthermore, cotransfection with an inducible expression vector coding the C&#x003b1; catalytic subunit of PKA (cPKA&#x003b1;), also favored the nuclear localization of these MAP kinases in the presence of PTP-SL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. C</xref>).

Our results, showing a crosstalk between the PKA and ERK1/2 and p38&#x003b1; kinases through the tyrosine phosphatase PTP-SL, support the existence of a novel mechanism by which PKA can regulate the activity of the MAP kinases and their translocation to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Such a mechanism would involve the existence, in certain cell types, of a pool of inactive MAP kinases outside of the nucleus, which would be complexed with PTP-SL or other KIM-containing PTPs, including STEP and HePTP (see below). The dissociation equilibrium of the complex would depend upon the cell type&#x02013; and the stimulus-specific conditions of PKA activity, and the lack of association would be favored by the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the KIM regulatory residue on the PTP. Thus, upon conditions of PKA activation, both the tyrosine phosphorylation and the entry into the nucleus of the MAP kinases would be prevalent. It should be noted that the expression of PTP-SL and related isoforms is restricted to specialized areas of the brain, including the Purkinje cells in the postnatal cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Watanabeetal1998">Watanabe et al. 1998</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="vandenMaagdenbergetal1999">van den Maagdenberg et al. 1999</xref>), suggesting the possibility of a differential regulation of MAP kinase functions by PTP-SL and PKA during brain development.</p><p>The mutational analysis of the KIM of PTP-SL has revealed that the residues involved in the PKA phosphorylation consensus sequence are also crucial for the docking of this phosphatase with ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x58145c0N0x50ff710">Z&#x000fa;&#x000f1;iga et al. 1999</xref>). Such residues are conserved between the related tyrosine phosphatases PTP-SL, STEP, and HePTP, which have been found to associate with MAP kinases and regulate their activation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pulidoetal1998">Pulido et al. 1998</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Oh-horaetal1999">Oh-hora et al. 1999</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Saxenaetal1999a">Saxena et al. 1999a</xref>). In this regard, while writing this manuscript, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Saxenaetal1999b">Saxena et al. 1999b</xref> have reported the negative role of PKA phosphorylation of the KIM of HePTP in the physical and functional association of HePTP with MAP kinases. Also, a tyrosine phosphatase from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, PTP-ER, has been found that inactivates MAP kinase, and that contains three KIMs with consensus phosphorylation sites for PKA (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="KarimandRubin1999">Karim and Rubin 1999</xref>). Finally, we have found that the retention of ERK2 outside of the nucleus is efficiently achieved by PTP-SL catalytically inactive mutants, as well as by truncated PTP-SL molecules lacking the PTP domain, demonstrating that this domain is dispensable in a such process. Thus, PKA-mediated KIM phosphorylations could have diverse regulatory effects on MAP kinase functions, depending on the functional properties of the affected KIM-containing molecule.</p><p>The involvement of distinct kinases in the in vivo phosphorylation of PTP-SL is likely to exist, which ultimately could control the biological functions of this PTP. Thus, the Thr<sup>253</sup> residue of PTP-SL is phosphorylated in vivo by ERK1/2 upon EGF cell treatment in a manner dependent of docking through the KIM (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pulidoetal1998">Pulido et al. 1998</xref>). Furthermore, the Thr<sup>253</sup> residue is also a putative PKC phosphorylation site, and PTP-SL is phosphorylated in vitro by this kinase (our unpublished observations). In this context, the binding of MAP kinases to the KIM of PTP-SL could mask the PKA phosphorylation motif by steric hindrance, hampering the phosphorylation of PTP-SL by PKA&#x0003b; conversely, phosphorylation of the KIM by PKA difficult the association of MAP kinases and the subsequent phosphorylation of the Thr<sup>253</sup> residue. The results presented here indicate a major regulatory role on the PTP-SL functions for the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the Ser<sup>231</sup> residue&#x0003b; accordingly, the basal phosphorylation of PTP-SL in COS-7 cells is found predominantly in such residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> B). On the other hand, the functional significance of the phosphorylation of the Thr<sup>253</sup> residue by ERK1/2 remains elusive. The possibility exists that phosphorylation of Thr<sup>253</sup> regulates the dissociation of PTP-SL from MAP kinases, as it has been suggested for HePTP (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Saxenaetal1999a">Saxena et al. 1999a</xref>). However, the cytoplasmic retention of ERK2 by PTP-SL was efficiently achieved upon conditions of EGF-induced phosphorylation of Thr<sup>253</sup> (our unpublished observations). In addition, phosphorylation of this residue could account for the regulated binding of PTP-SL to other unidentified molecules. The participation of specific serine/threonine phosphatases in the in vivo dephosphorylation of the Ser<sup>231</sup> and Thr<sup>253</sup> residues of PTP-SL is also expected. In this regard, we have found that cell treatment with okadaic acid induces hyperphosphorylation of the Ser<sup>231</sup> residue, suggesting an active role for PP2A in the in vivo dephosphorylation of this key residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Also, PP2A and PP2C have been shown to interfere with the activation of the MAP kinase pathways by affecting the phosphorylation of MAP kinases or upstream phosphorylation events (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Andersonetal1990">Anderson et al. 1990</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Chajryetal1996">Chajry et al. 1996</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Takekawaetal1998">Takekawa et al. 1998</xref>). Thus, a complex network of kinases and phosphatases could be envisioned within the MAP kinase pathways, which integrate the different signals to generate specific cell responses. The importance of the assembly of the molecular components that regulate the activation of the MAP kinases has been recently outlined (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="WhitmarshandDavis1998">Whitmarsh and Davis 1998</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="SchaefferandWeber1999">Schaeffer and Weber 1999</xref>). The results reported here point to PKA as a major regulator of the physical and functional association between the ERK1/2 and p38&#x003b1; kinases and their inactivating tyrosine phosphatases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank G.S.

Pools of MAP kinases are maintained in the cytoplasm and into the nucleus by the balance between activation stimuli and the PTP-SL (or other KIM-containing PTPs) inhibitory effects. Upon PKA activation, the association of PTP-SL with the MAP kinase is impaired, and MAP kinase tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation is favored. The putative regulatory role for serine/threonine phosphatases (PP) in the dephosphorylation of PTP-SL, is indicated (see details in the text).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB9909058.f5"/></fig></floats-wrap></article>
