We show that damaged human cells develop persistent chromatin lesions bearing hallmarks of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which initiate increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). Cytokine secretion occurred only after establishment of persistent DNA damage signaling, usually associated with senescence, not after transient DNA damage responses (DDR). Initiation and maintenance of this cytokine response required the DDR proteins ATM, NBS1 and CHK2, but not the cell cycle arrest enforcers p53 and pRb. ATM was also essential for IL-6 secretion during oncogene-induced senescence and by damaged cells that bypass senescence. Further, DDR activity and IL-6 were elevated in human cancers, and ATM-depletion suppressed the ability of senescent cells to stimulate IL-6-dependent cancer cell invasiveness. Thus, in addition to orchestrating cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair, a novel and important role of the DDR is to allow damaged cells to communicate their compromised state to the surrounding tissue.</p></abstract><contract-num rid="AG1">P30 AG025708-04

Among the first proteins to respond to DSBs is ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated), a member of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase-like kinase (PIKK) family. ATM substrates include H2AX, a nucleosomal histone variant, and p53 binding protein-1 (53BP1), which facilitates checkpoint activation and repair. Phosphorylated H2AX (<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>H2AX) and 53BP1 rapidly localize to DSBs, forming characteristic foci. ATM also phosphorylates the DDR kinase CHK2 (checkpoint kinase-2), which promotes growth arrest; NBS1 (Nijmegen breakage syndrome), a member of the MRN (MRE11-RAD51-NBS1) complex that reinforces the DDR and participates in DNA repair; and p53, a tumor suppressor and transcriptional regulator that orchestrates repair and cell cycle arrest (reviewed in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). DSBs that cannot be repaired (e.g., uncapped telomeres) cause constitutive DDR signaling, prolonged p53-dependent growth arrest, and eventually an essentially irreversible senescence arrest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>.</p><p id="P7">Despite understanding much about how the senescence arrest is initiated and maintained, little is known about how the SASP is regulated. We recently showed that the SASP is correlated with genotoxic stress, suggesting it is controlled by DDR signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>. However, p53, a key DDR effector, was not required for the SASP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, raising the possibility that the SASP and DDR are not linked. Here, we asked whether DDR components upstream of p53 regulate the SASP, focusing on two principal SASP factors, the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8.</p><p id="P8">We synchronously damaged DNA in HCA2 human diploid fibroblasts using ionizing radiation (X-ray). A relatively low dose (0.5 Gy) rapidly induced multiple 53BP1 foci in all nuclei and engaged the DDR, as indicated by p53 serine15 phosphorylation and upregulation of p21, a cell cycle inhibitor and p53 target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Both indicators returned to near-baseline levels within 10 h, as cells resolved the 53BP1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-c</xref>) and resumed growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S1a,b</xref>). A senescence-inducing dose (10 Gy) also triggered a rapid DDR; however, several 53BP1 foci failed to resolve, and increased in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-c</xref>). These persistent DNA damage foci (PDDF) contained <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>H2AX, and remained for days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S1d</xref>) and months (not shown), while cells remained arrested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S1a-b</xref>). PDDF also contained activated (phosphorylated) ATM and ATM/ATR substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Therefore, low dose radiation induced a transient DDR, from which cells recovered, whereas a high dose generated PDDF, localized but constitutive DDR signaling, and senescence.</p><p id="P9">Low dose radiation did not increase IL-6 secretion, which remained at control levels. A high dose, in contrast, increased IL-6 and IL-8 secretion 5- to 6-fold within 2&#x02212;4 d, and to replicatively senescent levels within 3&#x02212;5 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S1c</xref>). Human WI-38 fibroblasts behaved similarly (not shown). Thus, DNA damage and the DDR alone do not induce inflammatory cytokine secretion; rather, secretion develops, after a delay, when the damage is sufficient to generate PDDF and persistent DDR signaling.</p><p id="P10">To test this idea further, we used lentiviruses to express p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that causes a senescence arrest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>. The infected cells displayed few PDDF and secreted little IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S1e</xref>), yet expressed other senescence markers, including increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S1g-j</xref>). Conversely, &#x0003e;2 PDDF and high IL-6 secretion was evident in cells induced to senesce by conditions that caused DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-g</xref>). IL-8 secretion behaved similarly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S1k</xref>).</p><p id="P11">HCA2 fibroblasts undergo p53-dependent replicative senescence owing to short (dysfunctional) telomeres<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S2a</xref>). Accordingly, early passage cells had few PDDF, while senescent cells had three or more (p&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>, two-tailed student T-test for unpaired samples, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S2b-c</xref>). As the cells proliferated, PDDF accumulated gradually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, top), DNA synthesis declined, and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, bottom) and IL-8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S2d</xref>) secretion increased. IMR-90 human fibroblasts behaved similarly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S2e</xref>). We used immunostaining to assess cytokine expression, growth arrest (absence of DNA synthesis) and PDDF in single cells within senescing HCA2 populations. Proliferating cells can acquire dysfunctional telomeres prior to arresting growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>. Indeed, PDDF-positive cells did not necessarily fail to synthesize DNA, although they synthesized DNA less frequently than cells without PDDF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-c</xref>). IMR90 fibroblasts behaved similarly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S2f</xref>). Further, in late passage populations, many cells that synthesized DNA also showed robust immunostaining for IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>) and MMP3, another SASP factor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S2g</xref>). Together with the p16<sup>INK4a</sup> results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-g</xref>), these findings suggest that PDDF, rather than the senescence arrest <italic>per se</italic>, correlate with inflammatory cytokine secretion.</p><p id="P12">To corroborate this idea, we suppressed telomeric PDDF in early passage HCA2 cells by expressing telomerase (catalytic subunit, hTERT) for 20 population doublings (PDs). In contrast to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>; compare PD25&#x02212;40 to PD40&#x02212;60), hTERT-expressing cells displayed slightly decreased PDDF but no increase in IL-6 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Moreover, when hTERT-expressing cells exceeded the PD level at which unmodified cells completely senesce (PD71&#x02212;75), PDDF and IL-6 secretion were similar to, or lower than, early passage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). To confirm that rescued telomere dysfunction, rather than hTERT <italic>per se</italic>, caused the decline in PDDF and IL-6 secretion, we induced senescence in PD50 hTERT-expressing cells by X-irradiation. Radiation generated PDDF and greatly increased IL-6 secretion in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-g</xref>). Thus, hTERT reduced telomeric PDDF, but not radiation-induced PPDF (most of which are presumably non-telomeric). These results strengthen the idea that PDDF and persistent DDR signaling are responsible for inflammatory cytokine secretion.</p><p id="P13">To determine whether the tumor suppressors p53 and pRb were required for IL-6 secretion, we used lentiviruses to express either a short-hairpin RNA against p53 (shp53), GSE22 (a dominant peptide suppressor of p53 activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) or SV-40 T antigen (SV40LT, which inactivates p53 and pRb<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) in replicatively senescent HCA2 cells. As expected<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> for HCA2, which express low levels of endogenous p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, p53 inactivation reversed the senescence growth arrest and drove cells into crisis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S2a</xref>; not shown). 3&#x02212;4 PDs after infection, IL-6 secretion did not decline, but rather increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Thus, neither p53, pRB nor the senescence arrest was required for IL-6 secretion.</p><p id="P14">Likewise, we inactivated p53 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S3a</xref>) in early passage HCA2 cells using retrovirally-delivered GSE22. There was no change in either PDDF or IL-6 secretion after 5 PDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). However, 15 PDs after p53 inactivation, both IL-6 secretion and PDDF increased markedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). These increases also occurred following p53 depletion by shp53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), although they were more modest (perhaps owing to residual p53 levels; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S3b</xref>). Thus, p53 was not required to initiate PDDF-driven cytokine secretion, and loss of p53 function in proliferating cells gradually increased the levels of both PDDF and secreted IL-6.</p><p id="P15">To determine the contribution of telomeric PDDF to the increased IL-6 secretion by p53-deficient cells, we expressed hTERT in GSE-expressing cells that had developed high levels of IL-6 secretion. hTERT reduced both PDDF and IL-6 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), as it did for cells with wild-type p53 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S3c</xref>). Cells expressing hTERT and GSE22 did not grow faster than cells expressing GSE22 only, ruling out the possibility that hTERT enabled the expansion of a few clones with serendipitously low PDDF/IL-6 secretion. hTERT only partially reduced IL-6 and PDDF levels in p53-deficient cells, suggesting that dysfunctional or near-dysfunctional telomeres account for some, but not all, the PDDF in proliferating p53-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S3d</xref>). Nevertheless, even in actively dividing p53-deficient cells, reduced PDDF coincided with reduced IL-6 secretion.</p><p id="P16">ATM is a key responder to DNA damage and prominent component of PDDF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). We tested the idea that PDDF drive cytokine secretion by providing sustained DDR signaling. We infected HCA2 cells with lentiviruses encoding shRNAs against GFP (shGFP, control) or ATM (shATM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). ATM depletion (80&#x02212;90%) prevented the increased IL-6 secretion that normally occurs 9&#x02212;10 d following 10 Gy X-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). We obtained similar results using WI-38 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S3e-f</xref>). Additionally, ATM depletion in already (replicatively) senescent cells effectively abolished IL-6 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Finally, primary A-T fibroblasts, from patients carrying an inactivating mutation in ATM (ataxia telangiectasia), had low but detectable basal IL-6 secretion levels and completely lacked the 2&#x02212;3 d and 9&#x02212;10 d cytokine responses following 10 Gy X-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p><p id="P17">ATM shares many substrates with ATR, another PIKK, which is preferentially activated when cells are damaged during S-phase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>. To determine whether ATR was also important for the DNA damage cytokine response, we measured IL-6 secretion by primary fibroblasts from a Seckel syndrome patient. These cells have almost undetectable ATR levels owing to a splicing mutation. They also had relatively high basal levels of IL-6 secretion, but, nonetheless, IL-6 secretion increased after X-irradiation (10 Gy) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). The magnitude of the increase was smaller than the extent to which IL-6 secretion increased in wild-type cells, possibly because IL-6 secretion is already high in these cells or because ATR partly contributes to the cytokine response. Whatever the case, these findings support the idea that persistent DDR signaling drives IL-6 secretion, and that, while ATR might contribute to this response, ATM is essential.</p><p id="P18">To determine whether other DDR components were necessary for the DNA damage cytokine response, we depleted cells of either NBS1, an MRN component required for optimal ATM activity, or CHK2, another DDR kinase and downstream target of ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f-g</xref>). Similar to the effects of ATM depletion, NBS1 or CHK2 depletion essentially prevented the increased IL-6 secretion following 10 Gy X-irradiation and abolished the high IL-6 secretion by already senescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h-i</xref>). Thus, three major DDR components (ATM, NBS1 and CHK2) are essential for both establishing and maintaining the cytokine response to DNA damage.</p><p id="P19">To identify which SASP components respond to DDR signaling, we used antibody arrays to interrogate 120 cytokines and other factors secreted by senescent HCA2 cells. We focused on 16 factors that were significantly modulated by X-irradiation, the majority being upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). We compared the secretion levels of these 16 factors in control and ATM-depleted cells induced to senesce by X-irradiation (10 Gy). ATM depletion reduced the secretion of 7 of these 16 SASP factors, reducing IL-6 secretion 50-fold and IL-8 secretion 10-fold. Nine factors were unchanged by ATM depletion (&#x02264;1.4-fold the secretion level of non-depleted cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5b</xref>). Thus, ATM signaling does not regulate the entire SASP, but is required for a subset of SASP components, including the major inflammatory cytokines.</p><p id="P20">The SASP can promote cancer cell invasion, largely due to secreted IL-6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>. To determine the biological significance of the DDR-dependent cytokine response, we used conditioned medium (CM) from control and senescent (X-irradiated) ATM-depleted cells in invasion assays. As expected, human breast cancer cells (T47D) were stimulated to invade a basement membrane when exposed to CM from control senescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). This stimulatory activity was deficient, however, in CM from ATM-depleted senescent cells, but was largely restored by supplementing this CM with recombinant IL-6. Thus, DDR-dependent SASP factors can have a significant biological consequence.</p><p id="P21">Persistent DDR signaling has been detected <italic>in vivo</italic> in premalignant and malignant lesions in human breast, lung, skin, bladder and colon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>. To model premalignant cells, we used p53-defective HCA2-GSE22 fibroblasts after they spontaneously developed PDDF and increased IL-6 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). ATM depletion in these cells reduced IL-6 secretion by 70% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S3g</xref>), supporting the idea that DDR signaling can drive inflammatory cytokine secretion during neoplastic transformation. To determine whether IL-6 secretion and DDR signaling are linked <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used immunostaining to assess DDR/ATM activity and IL-6 expression in human breast cancer specimens. Both phosphorylated ATM/ATR substrates and IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in invasive ductal carcinomas compared to normal human breast tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S4</xref>). Thus, DDR signaling and inflammatory cytokine secretion correlated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P22">Inflammatory cytokine secretion is also a feature of cells that senesce due to oncogene activation (oncogene-induced senescence; OIS) in culture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, and of preneoplastic lesions in human colon, which presumably harbor activated oncogenes <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>. To determine whether DDR signaling is required for OIS-induced IL-6 secretion, we used lentiviral vectors to simultaneously express oncogenic RAS and shATM in HCA2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S3h</xref>). ATM-deficient cells undergo rapid replicative senescence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> but react to OIS depending on the oncogene and context<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>. As previously observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, oncogenic RAS-expressing fibroblasts underwent OIS regardless of their ATM status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Additionally, the RAS-expressing ATM-deficient cells developed a typical OIS morphology (enlargement, vacuolization) and 53BP1 foci that lacked detectable activated ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f-g</xref>). Oncogenic RAS also caused OIS and 53BP1 foci in primary A-T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>; not shown). Therefore, ATM depletion had no discernible effects on OIS phenotypes, including growth arrest and PDDF. However, ATM depletion effectively prevented OIS-driven IL-6 secretion in both A-T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>) and HCA2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>). Thus, ATM controls IL-6 secretion caused by multiple forms of damage-induced senescence, including OIS, which is known to occur <italic>in vivo</italic> (reviewed in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Our findings identify a novel response to persistent DNA damage &#x02013; the secretion of factors that allow damaged cells to communicate with their microenvironment. This response is associated with cellular senescence, but also occurs in damaged cycling cells that are near, or have bypassed, senescence. Our results suggest a model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information, Fig. S3i</xref>) in which mild genotoxic stress (e.g., 0.5 Gy X-ray, which generates &#x0223c;17 DSBs/nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) causes a DDR, damage foci, transient cell cycle arrest and repair, but does not induce inflammatory cytokine secretion. More severe genotoxic stress (e.g., dysfunctional telomeres, 10 Gy X-ray) produces PDDF and persistent DDR signaling, which establishes and maintains the p53-dependent senescence growth arrest. After several days, this DDR signaling also initiates the p53-<underline>independent</underline> cytokine response via ATM, NBS1 and CHK2. p53-deficient cells can initiate the cytokine response in the absence of growth arrest. By contrast, cells induced to senesce by p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression, but in the absence of DNA damage, do not initiate a cytokine response. Thus, the DDR can independently control at least two important phenotypes: the p53-dependent growth arrest and senescence-associated extracellular inflammatory signaling. Our results suggest that functions previously attributed to growth arrested senescent cells, specifically their ability to perturb the local microenvironment, can be acquired by damaged cells, whether or not they are senescent or competent to proliferate.</p><p id="P24">DDR signaling drives only a subset of SASP factors, but those include the potent inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. IL-6 was particularly important for the ability of senescent cells to promote cancer cell invasion. Hallmarks of persistent DNA damage are seen in pre-cancerous and malignant lesions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, which are presumed to harbor activated oncogenes, and in aging mammalian tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>. Our results suggest DDR signaling drives the inflammation that is also a hallmark of premalignant, malignant and aging tissues. During aging, damaged cells might cause or contribute to tissue dysfunction, including dysfunctional stem cell niches<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>. In cancer, such cells might promote inflammation, angiogenesis or other phenotypes of cancer progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>.</p><p id="P25">Why do damaged cells mount a cytokine response? One demonstrated possibility is to reinforce a growth arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. Presenescent levels of cytokines receptors are apparently sufficient to contribute to the rapid DDR growth arrest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. However, early experiments showed that senescent cells do not secrete factors that strongly inhibit the growth of nearby presenescent cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>. Thus, cytokines might reinforce a senescence arrest only when cells are moderately damaged or near senescent. The cytokine response might also act in a paracrine manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> to suppress or promote the proliferation of neighboring cells in damaged tissues, allowing damaged cells to communicate their compromised state to surrounding cells, and perhaps mobilize the immune system for their clearance. In support of this idea, tumors induced to senesce by genetic manipulation or chemotherapy regress, with evidence of activated innate immune cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, and senescent cells in injured liver appear to limit fibrosis before being cleared by the immune system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>. In this context, the delayed cytokine response to severe DNA damage could allow cells to attempt DNA repair before generating potent immune-mobilizing signals.</p><sec id="S1"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p id="P26">FR designed, performed and analyzed the experiments, JPC and CP performed antibody arrays, JPC and WAMH performed ELISAs, SRR analyzed immunofluorescence, AF analyzed tissue arrays, ARD, DPM and EC generated and tested p53 and ATM RNAi constructs, JC analyzed data, FR and JC wrote the paper.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cells</title><p id="P27">HCA2 foreskin fibroblasts were obtained from J.
