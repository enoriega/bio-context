1,100 aa residues, a domain known to interact with transmembrane proteins. p205 was copurified from rat brain  with another protein with a molecular mass of 190 kD  (p190). p190 was a protein of 1,663 aa with a calculated  molecular mass of 188,971 kD. p190 was a splicing variant of p205 having one PDZ domain at 1,009&#x02013;1,093 aa  residues but lacking the F-actin&#x02013;binding domain. Homology search analysis revealed that the aa sequence of  p190 showed 90% identity over the entire sequence  with the product of the <italic>AF-6</italic> gene, which was found to  be fused to the <italic>ALL-1</italic> gene, known to be involved in  acute leukemia. p190 is likely to be a rat counterpart of  human <italic>AF-6</italic> protein. p205 bound along the sides of  F-actin but hardly showed the F-actin&#x02013;cross-linking activity. Northern and Western blot analyses showed that  p205 was ubiquitously expressed in all the rat tissues  examined, whereas p190 was specifically expressed in  brain. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic studies revealed that p205 was concentrated  at cadherin-based cell-to-cell AJ of various tissues. We  named p205 l-afadin (a large splicing variant of AF-6  protein localized at adherens junction) and p190 s-afadin (a small splicing variant of l-afadin). These results  suggest that l-afadin serves as a linker of the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane at cell-to-cell AJ.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>I<sc>n </sc>various cellular events, such as cell adhesion, cell motility, and cell shape determination, specialized membrane domains are formed with transmembrane proteins, such as cell adhesion molecules, receptors, and  channels, and these domains are often associated with the  actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Geiger, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Geiger and Ginsberg,  1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Turner and Burridge, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Luna and Hitt, 1992</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Tsukita et al., 1992</xref>, 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bretscher, 1993</xref>). The linkage  between the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane  plays crucial roles in these cellular events, and proteins linking the actin cytoskeleton to the transmembrane proteins  have been identified. However, the molecular basis of the  linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane is not fully understood.</p><p>To understand this molecular linkage, the cell adhesion  sites have most extensively been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Geiger, 1983</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Geiger and Ginsberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Turner and Burridge,  1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Luna and Hitt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Tsukita et al., 1992</xref>, 1997;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bretscher, 1993</xref>). The actin filament (F-actin)<sup>1</sup>&#x02013;associated  cell adhesion sites are subclassed into two types: cell-to-cell  and cell-to-matrix adherens junctions (AJ). Many linker  proteins have been identified at cell-to-cell AJ where cadherins interact with each other at the extracellular surface  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Takeichi, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Geiger and Ginsberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Takeichi,  1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Tsukita et al., 1992</xref>). The cytoplasmic domain of cadherin is associated with cytoplasmic proteins such as &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-,  and &#x003b3;-catenins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Ozawa et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Nagafuchi et al., 1991</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Takeichi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Tsukita et al., 1992</xref>). &#x003b1;-Catenin directly interacts with F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Rimm et al., 1995</xref>). &#x003b1;-Catenin also interacts indirectly with F-actin through &#x003b1;-actinin and/or  ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Knudsen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Itoh et al., 1997</xref>). Vinculin, another F-actin&#x02013;binding protein, is concentrated at cell-to-cell AJ, although its interacting molecule at cell-to-cell AJ  has not yet been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Geiger and Ginsberg, 1991</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Tsukita et al., 1992</xref>). At cell-to-matrix AJ where integrin  interacts with matrix proteins at the extracellular surface,  the cytoplasmic domain interacts directly or indirectly  with F-actin&#x02013;binding proteins, including &#x003b1;-actinin, vinculin, and talin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Jockusch et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, many F-actin&#x02013; binding proteins appear to serve as linkers of the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane cadherin and integrin.</p><p>The linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and the  plasma membrane is also important for neuron-specific  events, such as growth cone pathfinding and the subsequent formation and maintenance of synaptic junction  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Smith, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bentley and  O'Connor, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Lin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Tanaka and Sabry, 1995</xref>).  However, it remains to be clarified which molecules link  the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane in these  neuron-specific events. To address this issue, we attempted  to isolate novel F-actin&#x02013;binding proteins from the rat brain  by using a blot overlay method with <sup>125</sup>I-labeled F-actin.  We had isolated a neural tissue-specific F-actin&#x02013;binding  protein that is concentrated at synapse and named it  neurabin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Nakanishi et al., 1997</xref>). Neurabin has one F-actin&#x02013; binding domain and one PDZ domain. The PDZ domain  has been found in a variety of proteins, some of which are  localized at cell-to-cell junctions, such as PSD-95/SAP90 at  synaptic junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Cho et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Kistner et al., 1993</xref>),  Dlg at septate junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Woods and Bryant, 1991</xref>), and  ZO-1 and ZO-2 at tight junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Stevenson et al., 1986</xref>;  Gumbiner, 1991; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Itoh et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">Tsukita et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Willott et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Jesaitis and Goodenough, 1994</xref>). Recent  studies have revealed that the PDZ domain binds to  unique COOH-terminal motifs of target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Saras  and Heldin, 1996</xref>), which are found in a large number of  transmembrane proteins, such as <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors and Shaker-type K<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Kim et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Kornau et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Niethammer et al., 1996</xref>). It is likely,  therefore, that neurabin serves as a linker of the actin cytoskeleton to a transmembrane protein(s) at the synapse  although we have not yet identified its interacting transmembrane protein(s).</p><p>Along this line, we further attempted to isolate other  novel F-actin&#x02013;binding proteins from rat brain. Here, we  isolated a novel F-actin&#x02013;binding protein with a molecular  mass of &#x0223c;205 kD (p205). p205 also had one F-actin&#x02013;binding domain and one PDZ domain, and was localized at  cadherin-based cell-to-cell AJ. During the purification of  p205, it was copurified with another protein with a molecular mass of 190 kD (p190) that was a splicing variant of  p205 having one PDZ domain but lacking the F-actin&#x02013; binding domain. Homology search analysis revealed that  the amino acid (aa) sequence of p190 showed 90% identity  over the entire sequence with the product of the <italic>AF-6</italic>  gene, which has been found to be fused to the <italic>ALL-1</italic> gene  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Prasad et al., 1993</xref>), known to be involved in acute leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cimino et al., 1991</xref>). We named p205 l-afadin (a large  splicing variant of AF-6 protein localized at adherens junction) and p190 s-afadin (a small splicing variant of l-afadin).  We describe here isolation and characterization of l-afadin.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title><sup>125</sup>I-labeled F-Actin Blot Overlay</title><p><sup>125</sup>I-labeled F-actin blot overlay was done as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Chia et al., 1991</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Pestonjamasp et al., 1995</xref>).

An indicated amount of GST&#x02013;l-afadin-C or His6&#x02013; l-afadin-C (each aa 1631&#x02013;1829) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 0.3 mg/ml of F-actin, and the mixture (100 &#x003bc;l) was placed over a  50-&#x003bc;l cushion of 30% sucrose in the polymerization buffer. After the sample was centrifuged at 130,000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min, the supernatant was removed  from the cushion, and the pellet was brought to the original volume in an  SDS sample buffer. To quantitate cosedimentation of GST&#x02013;l-afadin-C or  His6&#x02013;l-afadin-C, the comparable amounts of the supernatant and pellet  fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide gel), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with an antibody against  l-afadin as described below, and then incubated with <sup>125</sup>I-labeled protein  A. Amounts of the free and bound fusion proteins were calculated by determining the radioactivity from the supernatant and pellet fractions with  an image analyzer (Fujix BAS-2000II).</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies and Immunofluorescence Microscopy</title><p>A rabbit polyclonal antibody against l-afadin, which specifically recognized l-afadin, was directed against a 16-mer synthetic peptide corresponding to aa 1814&#x02013;1829 (KASRKLTELENELNTK).

The soluble fraction of rat fetal  brain was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by the blot  overlay. Several radioactive protein bands with various  molecular masses were detected. Of these F-actin&#x02013;binding  proteins, the protein band with a molecular mass of &#x0223c;205  kD (p205) was highly purified by column chromatographies, including Q-Sepharose, phenyl-5PW, hydroxyapatite, and Mono Q column chromatographies. On the final  Mono Q column chromatography, the F-actin&#x02013;binding  protein band well coincided with a protein with a molecular mass of &#x0223c;205 kD that was identified by protein staining  with Coomassie brilliant blue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). p205 was copurified  with another protein with a molecular mass of &#x0223c;190 kD  (p190), and they could not be separated from each other  by further column chromatographies, including Mono S  and Superdex 200 column chromatographies (data not  shown). These proteins appeared at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of &#x0003e;600 kD on the gel filtration.  The Mono Q sample including p205 and p190 was used to  study the biochemical properties of p205 as described below.</p><p>When the peptide mapping analyses of the Mono Q  sample of these two proteins, p205 and p190, were performed, their maps were almost identical, whereas p205  showed the additional peptide peaks. When the aa sequences of the five peptide peaks common between the  two proteins were separately determined, all the aa sequences of the p205 and p190 peptides were identical. A  computer homology search indicated that the aa sequences of the five peptide peaks were identical with or  significantly homologous to those of human AF-6 protein.  When the aa sequences of the two peptide peaks specific to  p205 were determined, they were not found in the current  protein database. These results suggest that p205 and p190  are related to human AF-6 protein, and that p190 is a splicing variant, a homologue, or a degradative product of p205.</p><p>A rat brain cDNA library was screened using the degenerated oligonucleotide probes designed from the partial aa  sequences of the seven peptide peaks described above. We  obtained several overlapping clones (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Among these  clones, clone 20 contained a coding region with &#x0223c;4.9 kb,  but it lacked a predicted initiation codon. The deduced aa  sequence included all the aa sequences of the peptides of  p205. This aa sequence analysis indicated that the aa sequences of the two peptides specific to p205 were both located in the COOH-terminal region. Clone 94 contained a  coding region with &#x0223c;4.5 kb and an in-frame stop codon  upstream of the stop codon of clone 20. This clone also  lacked a predicted initiation codon. The deduced aa sequence of the coding region included all the aa sequences  of the peptides of p190, but not those of the peptides specific to p205. Clone 84 contained a coding region with &#x0223c;4.2  kb and a predicted initiation codon. To confirm whether  these cDNAs were derived from the same locus, we made  the chromosomal assignment by FISH analysis using the  cDNAs as probes. All the cDNAs were localized on rat  chromosome 1q12.2 (data not shown). </p><p>The full-length p205 and p190 cDNAs were constructed  from clones 84 and 20, and clones 84 and 94, respectively.  When the p205 cDNA was transfected into COS7 cells and  the cell extract was subjected to <sup>125</sup>I-labeled F-actin blot  overlay, the recombinant protein (myc&#x02013;l-afadin) showed  mobility similar to that of native p205 on SDS-PAGE, as  well as <sup>125</sup>I-labeled F-actin&#x02013;binding activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> <italic>a</italic>). The  deletion mutant of p205 lacking the COOH-terminal 156  aa (myc&#x02013;l-afadin&#x00394;C) did not show the <sup>125</sup>I-labeled F-actin&#x02013; binding activity. A fusion protein of the COOH-terminal  region of p205 (199 aa) with GST (GST&#x02013;l-afadin-C) showed  the <sup>125</sup>I-labeled F-actin&#x02013;binding activity. </p><p>Based on these observations, together with the fact that  the Mono Q sample of p205 indeed showed the F-actin&#x02013; binding activity as described below, we have concluded  that the p205 gene encodes a protein of 1,829 aa with a calculated molecular mass of 207,667 kD (Gen Bank/EMBL/ DDBJ accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="U83230">U83230</ext-link>), of which the COOH-terminal 199 aa contributes to its F-actin&#x02013;binding activity,  and that the p190 gene encodes a protein lacking &#x0223c;160  COOH-terminal aa (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession  number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="U83231">U83231</ext-link>) and is a splicing variant of the p205 gene.  A computer homology search revealed that the aa sequence of p190 showed 90% identity over the entire sequence with that of human AF-6 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Prasad et al.,  1993</xref>), while human AF-6 protein and p190 lacked the  COOH-terminal region of p205. p190 is likely to be a rat  counterpart of human AF-6 protein. The COOH-terminal,  F-actin&#x02013;binding domain showed no significant homology  to any known F-actin&#x02013;binding protein. Both p205 and  p190 had one PDZ domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> <italic>b</italic>). We named p205 and  p190 l- and s-afadins, respectively.</p><p>Northern blot analysis using a sequence specific to the  l-afadin cDNA as a probe detected &#x0223c;7.5-kb mRNA in all  the rat tissues examined, including the heart, brain, spleen,  lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> <italic>a</italic>). A  similar result was obtained when a sequence common between the cDNAs of l- and s-afadins was used as a probe  (data not shown). Western blot analysis using an antibody  specific to l-afadin detected an &#x0223c;205-kD protein in all the  rat tissues examined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> <italic>b1</italic>). When an antibody recognizing both l- and s-afadins was used, however, an &#x0223c;190-kD protein was detected only in the brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> <italic>b2</italic>).  These results indicate that l-afadin is expressed ubiquitously while s-afadin is specifically expressed in brain. The  reason why the Northern blot analysis did not detect the  two bands in the brain may simply be because of the similar length of the mRNAs of l- and s-afadins. </p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical Properties of l-Afadin</title><p>It was examined by competition experiments whether the  Mono Q sample of l-afadin (including s-afadin) bound along  the sides of F-actin or at its ends. The binding of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled  F-actin to l-afadin was completely inhibited by an excessive amount of myosin S1, a well-characterized protein  that binds along the sides of F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Rayment et al., 1993</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Schr&#x000f6;der et al., 1993</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> <italic>a</italic>). This inhibition was reversed by the addition of MgATP because MgATP dissociates the actin&#x02013;myosin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Fraser et al., 1975</xref>). These  results indicate that l-afadin binds along the sides of F-actin.  The effect of the Mono Q sample of l-afadin on F-actin was  examined using the falling ball method for low shear viscometry. This effect was compared to that of &#x003b1;-actinin, a  well-characterized protein that shows F-actin&#x02013;cross-linking  activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Burridge and Feramisco, 1981</xref>). l-Afadin increased  the viscosity of F-actin in a dose-dependent manner, and the  viscosity became maximal at approximately threefold (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> <italic>b</italic>). &#x003b1;-Actinin also increased the viscosity, but the viscosity  became unmeasurably high. This effect of the Mono Q sample of l-afadin on F-actin was further assessed by transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained specimens.  l-Afadin hardly caused F-actin to associate into bundles  and meshworks under conditions where &#x003b1;-actinin showed a  marked F-actin&#x02013;cross-linking activity (data not shown).  This result was consistent with that of the low shear viscometry. The stoichiometry of the binding of l-afadin to  actin and the affinity constant were examined using His6&#x02013; l-afadin-C. The stoichiometry was calculated to be 1 His6&#x02013; l-afadin-C molecule per &#x0223c;500 actin molecules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> <italic>c</italic>).  The kilodalton value was calculated to be the order of 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>.  A similar result was obtained with GST&#x02013;l-afadin-C (data  not shown). The effect of the Mono Q sample of l-afadin  on actin polymerization was finally examined using pyrene-conjugated actin. Pyrene-conjugated actin is known to increase its fluorescent intensity with the actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Cooper and Pollard, 1982</xref>). l-Afadin did not affect the  actin polymerization under the conditions where gelsolin  stimulated it (data not shown). </p></sec><sec><title>Localization of l-Afadin at Cadherin-based  Cell-to-Cell AJ</title><p>The localization of l-afadin was first examined by immunofluorescence microscopy of the frozen sections of various rat or mouse tissues using the anti&#x02013;l-afadin antibody.  In the liver, l-afadin was localized at the beltlike junctional  complex region along the bile canaliculi (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> <italic>a</italic>). When  the frozen sections of the small intestine were doubly  stained with the monoclonal anti&#x02013;E-cadherin, l-afadin was  concentrated with E-cadherin at the junctional complex  region of intestine absorptive epithelia, but l-afadin was  more highly concentrated at the junctional complex region  than E-cadherin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <italic>b1&#x02013;3</italic> and <italic>c1&#x02013;3</italic>). The frozen sections of the heart were doubly stained with the monoclonal  antivinculin antibody. Vinculin is known to be a marker,  not only for cell-to-cell AJ, but also for cell-to-matrix AJ  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Geiger, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1983</xref>). l-Afadin was colocalized with vinculin at the intercalated disc (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> <italic>d1&#x02013;3</italic>). Vinculin was also  periodically located along the lateral borders of cardiac  muscle cells (costamere) while l-afadin was not. When the  cultured EL cells expressing E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Nagafuchi et al.,  1987</xref>) were doubly stained with the anti&#x02013;ZO-1 antibody,  l-afadin showed localization similar to that of ZO-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>,  <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>). ZO-1 is known to be concentrated at cadherin-based, spotlike cell-to-cell AJ in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Itoh et al.,  1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">1993</xref>). These results suggest that l-afadin is localized  at cadherin-based cell-to-cell AJ.  </p><p>To examine the precise localization of l-afadin at the junctional complex region, the frozen sections of small intestine were doubly stained with the monoclonal anti&#x02013;ZO-1  antibody, and the bile canaliculi isolated from liver were  doubly stained with the monoclonal antidesmoplakin antibody. ZO-1 and desmoplakin are known to be markers for  tight junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Stevenson et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Itoh et al., 1993</xref>) and  desmosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Skerrow and Matoltsy, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Franke et al.,  1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Mueller and Franke, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Miller et al., 1987</xref>), respectively. In the absorptive epithelia, l-afadin was localized slightly more at the basal side than ZO-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> <italic>a1&#x02013;a3</italic>).  In the canaliculi, the localization of l-afadin did not coincide with that of desmoplakin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> <italic>b1&#x02013;b3</italic>). These results  indicate that l-afadin is localized at cell-to-cell AJ rather  than at tight junction or desmosome. The localization of  l-afadin at cell-to-cell AJ was finally confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy of intestine absorptive epithelia using  the silver enhancement and ultrathin cryosection techniques. l-Afadin was associated with the undercoat of cell-to-cell AJ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>).  </p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we isolated a novel F-actin&#x02013;binding protein with a  molecular mass of &#x0223c;205 kD (p205). This protein was copurified with another protein with a molecular mass of 190 kD  (p190) that lacked the F-actin&#x02013;binding activity on various  column chromatographies. The molecular cloning of the  cDNAs of these two proteins revealed that the nucleotide  sequence of the p190 cDNA was identical to that of the  p205 cDNA, except for the two splicing regions. FISH  analysis revealed that the genes of these two proteins were  localized at the same locus. These results suggest that p205  and p190 are splicing variants derived from the same gene.  Because a computer homology search revealed that the aa  sequence of p190 was almost identical to that of human  AF-6 protein, we theorize that p190 may be a rat counterpart of human AF-6 protein. We named p205 and p190 l- and  s-afadins, respectively. Further purification steps of l-afadin, including Mono S column and Superdex 200 column  chromatographies, did not separate l- and s-afadins from  each other, and their elution profiles on these column  chromatographies were similar but not identical. These  proteins appeared at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of &#x0003e;600 kD on the gel filtration. These results  suggest that 1- and s-afadins form a complex, but we cannot exclude the possibility that these two proteins do not  form a complex, but instead are incidentally eluted at similar fractions on these column chromatographies. It is,  therefore, possible that the complex is composed of a heterooligomer alone, a homooligomer alone, or the mixture.  Western blot analysis indicated that the tissues other than  brain expressed l-afadin alone. It is likely that l-afadin  forms a homooligomer in these tissues.</p><p>Recently, Luna's group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Pestonjamasp et al., 1995</xref>) has  shown that a protein with a molecular mass of &#x0223c;205 kD in  bovine neutrophils has the <sup>125</sup>I-labeled F-actin&#x02013;binding activity. When human neutrophils were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed either by Western blot analysis using the  antibody specific to l-afadin or by <sup>125</sup>I-labeled F-actin blot  overlay, an immunoreactive band with a molecular mass of  &#x0223c;200 kD was detected, and this band showed the <sup>125</sup>I-labeled  F-actin&#x02013;binding activity (data not shown). This protein  band is likely to be l-afadin, although its molecular mass  was slightly smaller than that of rat l-afadin. The different  molecular mass values may result from the species' differences. The exact relationship between the 205-kD protein  described by Luna's group and l-afadin is not known, since  the primary structure of the 205-kD protein has not been  determined, but the 205-kD protein may be l-afadin.</p><p>l-Afadin showed <sup>125</sup>I-labeled F-actin&#x02013;binding activity.  Neither s-afadin nor the deletion mutant of l-afadin lacking the COOH-terminal 156 aa (myc&#x02013;l-afadin&#x00394;C) showed  this activity, whereas GST&#x02013;l-afadin-C corresponding to the  COOH-terminal 199 aa showed the <sup>125</sup>I-labeled F-actin&#x02013; binding activity. The Mono Q sample of l-afadin increased  the viscosity of F-actin on the low shear viscometry. Furthermore, His6&#x02013;l-afadin-C corresponding to the COOH-terminal 199 aa was cosedimented with F-actin. These results indicate that l-afadin shows F-actin&#x02013;binding activity  and that the domain responsible for this activity is located  at the COOH-terminal 199 aa. Many actin-binding protein  families have been isolated and characterized. Of these  families, for instance, the &#x003b1;-actinin/spectrin family members have been shown to usually form oligomers, such as a  homodimer or a heterotetramer, and thereby show the  F-actin&#x02013;cross-linking activity. &#x003b1;-Actinin made the viscosity  of F-actin unmeasurably high on the low shear viscometry,  and it caused F-actin to associate into bundles and meshworks, as estimated by transmission electron microscopy.  The stoichiometry is one &#x003b1;-actinin molecule per about  seven actin molecules, and the kilodalton value is the order of 10 <sup>&#x02212;7</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Meyer and Aebi, 1990</xref>). In contrast, the effect  of the Mono Q sample of l-afadin on F-actin was small on  the low shear viscometry, and the sample hardly showed  F-actin&#x02013;cross-linking activity, as estimated by transmission  electron microscopy. The stoichiometry was calculated to  be 1 His6&#x02013;l-afadin-C molecule per &#x0223c;500 actin molecules.  The kilodalton value was calculated to be the order of  10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>. These results indicate that l-afadin belongs to a family different from the &#x003b1;-actinin/spectrin family. The ERM  family, including ezrin, radixin, and moesin, belongs to the  band 4.1 superfamily, an F-actin&#x02013;binding protein superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bretscher, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Tsukita et al., 1997</xref>), and there  have been several reports that purified ezrin and moesin  are hardly cosedimented with F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bretscher, 1983</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Pestonjamasp et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Shuster and Herman, 1995</xref>).  Luna's group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Pestonjamasp et al., 1995</xref>) has recently  shown by the <sup>125</sup>I-labeled F-actin blot overlay that ezrin  and moesin exhibit the F-actin&#x02013;binding activity. They have  also shown by competition experiments using the <sup>125</sup>I-labeled  F-actin blot overlay that ezrin and moesin bind along the  sides of F-actin. The biochemical properties of l-afadin are  apparently similar to those of ezrin and moesin. l-Afadin  may bind F-actin in a manner similar to those of ezrin and  moesin.</p><p>An immunofluorescence microscopic study by use of the  antibody specific to l-afadin revealed that l-afadin was localized at the junctional complex region. Further microscopic  and electron microscopic studies revealed that l-afadin was  concentrated at cadherin-based cell-to-cell AJ. Taken together with the biochemical properties of l-afadin, l-afadin  is likely to be involved in the linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and cell-to-cell AJ. Both l- and s-afadins have  one PDZ domain. The PDZ domain has been found in a  variety of proteins that are typically localized at cell-to-cell  junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Saras and Heldin, 1996</xref>) and shown to bind to  the unique COOH-terminal motifs of target proteins, which  are found in a large number of transmembrane proteins  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Kim et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Kornau et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Niethammer et al.,  1996</xref>). l-Afadin may be recruited to cell-to-cell AJ through  its PDZ domain. To understand the mechanism by which  l-afadin is localized at cell-to-cell AJ, it is of crucial importance to identify its interacting molecule(s).</p><p>Many F-actin&#x02013;binding proteins, including &#x003b1;-actinin, talin,  and vinculin, have been shown to serve as linkers between  the actin cytoskeleton and integrin at cell-to-matrix AJ  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Jockusch et al., 1995</xref>). The cytoplasmic domain of the  &#x003b2;-subunit of integrin interacts directly with &#x003b1;-actinin and  talin and indirectly with vinculin through &#x003b1;-actinin and  talin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Jockusch et al., 1995</xref>). At cell-to-cell AJ, the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin interacts with &#x003b1;-catenin through  &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Ozawa et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Nagafuchi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Takeichi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Tsukita et al., 1992</xref>). &#x003b1;-Catenin interacts directly  with F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Rimm et al., 1995</xref>), &#x003b1;-actinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Knudsen et al.,  1995</xref>), and ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Itoh et al., 1997</xref>). Vinculin is highly concentrated at cell-to-cell AJ, but its interacting molecule  has not yet been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Geiger and Ginsberg, 1991</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Tsukita et al., 1992</xref>). We showed here that l-afadin was localized at cell-to-cell AJ. Therefore, the molecular linkage  mechanism between the actin cytoskeleton and cadherin is  apparently similar to that between the actin cytoskeleton  and integrin in the sense that F-actin is linked to each transmembrane protein through multiple F-actin&#x02013;binding proteins.</p><p>The <italic>AF-6</italic> gene has originally been identified as a fusion  partner of the <italic>ALL-1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Prasad et al., 1993</xref>), which is  known to be involved in acute leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cimino et al.,  1991</xref>). It has recently been shown that the <italic>AF-6</italic> gene maps  outside the minimal region of deletion in ovarian cancers  with similar chromosomal aberrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Saha et al., 1995</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Saito et al., 1996</xref>). However, neither the significance of the  fusion of these two genes nor the role of s-afadin in carcinogenesis has been clarified. s-Afadin has recently been  shown to have significant homology to the product of the  <italic>Drosophila canoe</italic> gene (Miyamato et al., 1995). The <italic>canoe</italic>  gene interacts genetically with the <italic>Notch</italic> signal cascade in  the eye, bristle, and wing development (Miyamato et al.,  1995). Moreover, the <italic>canoe</italic> gene interacts genetically with  the <italic>armadillo</italic> (<italic>&#x003b2;-catenin</italic>) gene (Miyamato et al., 1995).  The products of the <italic>Notch</italic> and <italic>armadillo</italic> genes have been  implicated in adhesive cell-to-cell communications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Peifer  et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1995</xref>). l- and s-Afadins may also play a role in the development of various tissues by mediating interactions between the adhesive molecule&#x02013;initiated signal transduction pathways.</p><p>The AF-6 protein (s-afadin) has recently been shown to  interact specifically with the GTP-bound active form of  Ras small G protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Kuriyama et al., 1996</xref>); however, we  have not been able to reproduce this earlier finding. We  found that both the GDP- and GTP-bound forms of Ki-Ras interacted with l- and s-afadins to similar extents and  that the stoichiometry of these interactions was negligible  (data not shown). Moreover, an immunofluorescence microscopic study of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably  expressing an myc-tagged dominant active mutant of Ki-Ras (N12V) or an myc-tagged wild type of Ki-Ras showed  that these two types of Ras are not concentrated at cell-to-cell AJ (Takaishi, K., and Y. Takai, unpublished observations). All of these results do not support the specific interaction of Ras with s-afadin, and the relationship between  Ras and s-afadin is currently unknown.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Mono Q column chromatography.
