Previously described receptors on blood- derived macrophages have been characterized in the absence of serum and show a relatively  low uptake of apoptotic cells. Addition of serum to the phagocytosis assays increased the uptake  of apoptotic cells by more than threefold. The serum factors responsible for enhanced uptake  were identified as complement components that required activation of both the classical pathway and alternative pathway amplification loop. Exposure of phosphatidylserine on the apoptotic cell surface was partially responsible for complement activation and resulted in coating the  apoptotic cell surface with C3bi. In the presence of serum, the macrophage receptors for C3bi,  CR3 (CD11b/CD18) and CR4 (CD11c/CD18), were significantly more efficient in the uptake of apoptotic cells compared with previously described receptors implicated in clearance.  Complement activation is likely to be required for efficient uptake of apoptotic cells within the  systemic circulation, and early component deficiencies could predispose to systemic autoimmunity by enhanced exposure to and/or aberrant deposition of apoptotic cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>complement</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>complement receptors</kwd><kwd>autoimmunity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Although the apoptotic cell death program is executed  in hours, the removal of dying cells is normally so  rapid that few cells are seen&#x02014;even in tissues such as the  thymus, where up to 95% of cells undergo apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).

Since conditions have been established for reliable  induction of apoptosis of murine thymocytes with minimal  necrosis (&#x0003c;5% and 2% uptake of propidium iodide and trypan blue, respectively [16]), initial experiments were performed with murine thymocytes. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <italic>A</italic>  and <italic>B</italic>, heat-labile serum factor(s) induced at least a 10-fold  increase in the PI that was dependent on time, temperature, and serum concentration. In the presence of 15% serum, at least 5 apoptotic cells were engulfed by most macrophages as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> <italic>C</italic>, whereas 0&#x02013;1 cells were  macrophage associated in the absence of serum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> <italic>D</italic>).  Similar results were observed when apoptosis was induced  by dexamethasone (results not shown). The experiments  were then repeated in an entirely autologous system, i.e.,  using serum and macrophages as well as apoptotic neutrophils or T cells from the same donor. In the absence of serum, the PI was 37 &#x000b1; 19, similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), but was 156 &#x000b1; 28 in the presence of serum (representative examples are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <italic>E&#x02013;G</italic>). </p><p>To distinguish between the requirement for serum factor(s) for opsonization (see below) versus uptake of apoptotic cells, apoptotic lymphocytes were incubated either  with 15% autologous serum or medium without serum for  1 h at 37&#x000b0;C and the phagocytosis assay was performed in  the absence of serum (two step assay). In the absence of serum at both steps, the baseline PI was 25 &#x000b1; 14 compared  with 81 &#x000b1; 19 when apoptotic lymphocytes had been exposed to serum but the phagocytosis assay performed in the  absence of serum. These findings indicate that serum factor(s) were more important for opsonization of the apoptotic cell than at the stage of phagocytosis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Complement Components Are Required for Efficient Uptake of  Apoptotic Cells by Human Macrophages.</title><p>The marked enhancement of the PI induced by a serum factor that was abrogated  by heating to 56&#x000b0;C for 30 min suggested that complement  components could be responsible for the uptake of apoptotic cells. To determine whether proteins of the classical  and/or alternative complement pathways were required for  phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, we evaluated the PI in the  presence of serum depleted of specific complement components (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). When apoptotic neutrophils or T lymphocytes were used as targets, normal or C9-deficient serum augmented the PI three- to fivefold. In contrast,  serum depleted of Factor B, C1q, or C3 (not shown) had a  PI only slightly greater than the NoS control. To verify the  specificity of these observations, we performed add-back  experiments with the purified complement components  C1q, Factor B, C3, and C9. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, when  the appropriate complement component was added to the  C1q- or Factor B&#x02013;deficient serum, the PI returned to the  value observed in the presence of 15% serum. Addition of  C1q in the absence of serum did not restore the PI (data  not shown). Similar results were obtained when murine  thymocytes, Jurkat T cells, or BL-41 B cells were used as  apoptotic targets in these experiments (not shown). </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>PS Exposure Activates Complement.</title><p>To further investigate the mechanism responsible for complement activation,  we examined whether the major C3 breakdown product,  C3bi, was deposited on the surface of apoptotic neutrophils  or lymphocytes by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, apoptotic lymphocytes (<italic>B</italic>) and neutrophils (<italic>E</italic>, <italic>top right</italic>) but  not nonapoptotic lymphocytes (<italic>A</italic>) or neutrophils (<italic>D</italic>, <italic>bottom left</italic>) stained positively for C3bi. Two-color flow cytometry (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> <italic>E</italic>) revealed that 31% of the neutrophils  were in the early apoptotic stage (annexin V positive, PI  negative [not shown]; <italic>top</italic> and <italic>bottom right</italic> [17]) and that  C3bi coated 61% of the apoptotic cells and &#x0003e;90% of the  annexin V<sup>high</sup> apoptotic population (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> <italic>E</italic>, <italic>top right</italic>). PS  has been shown to serve as a specific ligand for recognition  of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Recognition of PS is particularly  relevant to the engulfment of apoptotic cells, since PS is an  acidic phospholipid that normally resides on the inside of  the cell, but translocates to the outside of the cell membrane  when the cell undergoes apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). To determine  whether blocking PS exposure on the apoptotic cells would  inhibit complement activation, we preincubated apoptotic  cells with annexin V, exposed the cells to serum, and then  quantified C3bi exposure by flow cytometry. As shown in  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>, annexin V substantially reduced, but did  not completely inhibit, C3bi deposition. These findings  strongly suggest that PS on the surface of apoptotic cells is at  least partially responsible for complement activation. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Complement Receptors Are Required for Efficient Uptake of  Opsonized Apoptotic Cells.</title><p>Human monocytes and macrophages express three known receptors, CR1, CR3, and  CR4, that bind complement proteins or their degradation  products. CR1 (CD35) binds mainly C3b, C4b, and C1q  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), whereas CR3 (CD11b/CD18) and CR4 (CD11c/ CD18) are relatively specific for C3bi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Since apoptotic  cells were coated with C3bi, we performed blocking experiments with mAbs specific to the complement receptors  in order to evaluate their role in ligand binding. As shown  in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, mAbs to CR3, CR4, and CR1 inhibited uptake  of apoptotic neutrophils by 60 &#x000b1; 8, 50 &#x000b1; 4, and 11 &#x000b1; 7%,  respectively. Since most prior studies of receptors and  ligands implicated in engulfment of mammalian apoptotic  cells were performed in the absence of serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>),  we evaluated their role in the presence of serum using  mAbs or ligands to inhibit their binding. As shown in Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> <italic>A</italic>, all three receptors were highly expressed on the  surface of human monocyte&#x02013;derived macrophages. Only  RGDS (which is thought not to inhibit CD11/CD18 [22])  significantly inhibited uptake of apoptotic cells under these  conditions, although specific inhibition (inhibition by  RGDS-RGES) was only 16% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> <italic>B</italic>). </p><p>To definitively test the role of CR3 in the recognition of  apoptotic cells, we examined the ability of a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with CR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>)  to phagocytose apoptotic cells. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> <italic>C</italic>, the  PI of nontransfected CHO cells was near baseline in the  presence or absence of serum, whereas the CR3-transfected cell line CHO-R3 had a PI approximating that observed in human macrophages in the presence of serum and  showed extensive rosetting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> <italic>B</italic>). </p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>These studies demonstrate for the first time that both the  classical and alternative pathways of complement are activated by apoptotic cells in isologous conditions leading to  deposition of C3bi on the apoptotic cell surface, that PS is  at least partially involved in this activation, and that recognition of ligand by the macrophage complement receptors  CR3 and CR4 is the most efficient mechanism of uptake  of apoptotic cells in the presence of serum. Since C1q has  been reported to bind to apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), the results of  our studies suggest that apoptotic cells activate the classical  pathway but that amplification via the alternative pathway  loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) is required for efficient recognition by macrophages. The requirement for both classical and alternative  complement pathway activation for efficient uptake of autologous apoptotic cells differs from reports of exclusive alternative pathway activation by the transformed cell lines,  Jurkat T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and a lung adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).  These differences may be explained by the conditions and/ or reagents used. For example, the use of serum with selective complement component deficiency revealed that complement activation by hemodialysis membranes, long thought  to be mediated exclusively by the alternative pathway, required initiation by the classical pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Also, in  studies by Nagasawa and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), apoptosis was induced by antibody (anti-Fas) and a transformed macrophage-like cell, THP-1, used for phagocytosis.</p><p>During apoptosis, a key alteration to the cell surface  membrane is the translocation of the negatively charged PS  from the inside to the outside of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In addition, it is known that PS exposure on apoptotic cells is required for efficient uptake of apoptotic cells by phagocytes  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). To determine whether PS exposure, complement activation, and phagocytic recognition of cell-bound complement products could be sequential steps in a physiological  pathway for removal of apoptotic cells, we first examined  the relationship between PS exposure on the cell membrane and complement activation. Annexin V binds to PS  on the cell surface in a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).  Therefore, we examined whether annexin V would compete for complement binding and activation. The &#x0223c;40%  reduction in C3bi deposition on apoptotic cells preincubated with annexin V strongly suggests that exposure of PS  either directly or indirectly activates complement. The detection of C3bi on almost all of the annexin V<sup>hi</sup> expressing  cells and the failure of annexin V to completely inhibit  complement activation suggest that the binding sites for  complement and annexin V are overlapping but not identical and/or that other molecules contribute to complement  activation.</p><p>Negatively charged phospholipids such as cardiolipin  have previously been shown to activate C1 in the absence  of antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Furthermore, clearance of PS-containing  liposomes by the liver is complement dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).  These observations reinforce the findings that PS activates  complement and is required for uptake by fixed macrophages. The reason why complement activation on apoptotic cells fails to cause lysis of the cell is uncertain but may  be explained by modulation of complement regulatory  molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), binding of additional serum proteins on  the surface of apoptotic cells, alteration in the composition  of the cell surface membrane, the rapid removal of opsonized cells, or a combination of these factors.</p><p>Complement activation and amplification via the alternative pathway loop rapidly lead to cleavage of C3 and covalent binding of C3b to the activating cell surface. In the  presence of serum, Factor I proteolytically cleaves C3b to  C3bi. Whereas C3b has a half-life of only 90 s, the half-life  of C3bi is &#x0223c;35 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), accounting for its major role in  opsonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). To compare the relative roles of the  macrophage complement receptors that recognize C3bi  (CR3 and CR4) with previously described apoptotic cell  receptor/ligand systems, we analyzed the effect of different  inhibitory mAbs or peptides on the uptake of apoptotic  cells by macrophages in the presence of serum. For human  peripheral blood&#x02013;derived macrophages, only blockade of  CR3 or CR4 reduced the PI by &#x0003e;50%, whereas blockade  of previously described receptors or ligands had a modest  effect (&#x0003c;20% inhibition). The dominant role of the complement receptors CR3 and CR4 in the uptake of apoptotic cells in the presence of serum suggests that complement may play the most active role in removal of apoptotic  cells in vivo (see below). In view of the cross-talk between  integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), it is possible that complement receptor  engagement suppresses or has a transdominant inhibitory  effect on other integrin-containing receptors.</p><p>The failure of previous studies to demonstrate a role for  complement receptors in the uptake of apoptotic cells in  vitro is, most likely, explained by the omission of serum in  these assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) or aging of neutrophils in the presence of  serum before the phagocytic assay in the absence of serum  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In the latter study, complement is likely to have been  activated with the deposition of C3bi on the apoptotic  neutrophil in the &#x0201c;aging&#x0201d; step and thereby may account for  the lack of a requirement for serum in the phagocytosis assay. Complement components may also have been secreted  by the macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) in the 4-h assay period. When apoptotic cells were exposed to serum but the phagocytosis  step was performed in the absence of serum, we also observed that the PI was increased more than threefold. The  slightly lower PI in the two step assay compared with the  one step assay could be explained by increased proteolysis  of C3bi by serum factors such as Factor I, or may indicate that  other serum factors are required for optimal phagocytosis.</p><p>CR3 and CR4 have interesting relationships with previously described phagocytic receptors for apoptotic cells.  The CD14 binding sites for apoptotic cells and LPS on human macrophages are identical or very close (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Since  CR3 and CR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) also bind to LPS/LPS-binding protein,  these receptors may have a similar hydrophobic lipid binding site or CD14, a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)- linked membrane protein, may associate with the exodomains  of the complement receptors to promote phagocytosis and/ or signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) after exposure to apoptotic cells.  Another recently described protein proposed to be involved in the engulfment of cell corpses is the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>  protein CED-5 (the mammalian and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>  homologues are DOCK 180 and Myoblast city, respectively [44]). Interestingly, DOCK 180 interacts with CRK,  a protein that regulates integrin-mediated ras signal transduction (for a review, see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Taken together  with the results reported here, these findings suggest a possible relationship between engagement of the two integrins  and activation of apoptotic cell engulfment.</p><p>The requirement for complement activation in the efficient uptake of autologous apoptotic cells appears contrary  to the notion that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is a noninflammatory process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). However, binding and phagocytosis via macrophage CR3 do not trigger leukotriene release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) or a respiratory burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Furthermore,  ligation of CR3 and other complement receptors may actually be immunosuppressive by downregulating IL-12 and  IFN-&#x003b3; production by human monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Therefore, it seems likely that the pro- or antiinflammatory consequences of complement activation on macrophages depends on the specific ligands encountered and receptors  engaged (see below).</p><p>During the normal turnover of lymphocytes and myeloid cells, billions of apoptotic cells need to be eliminated  daily within the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). The results of these studies suggest an important homeostatic role for complement  in the noninflammatory clearance of apoptotic cells. Since  complement activation is required for efficient phagocytic  uptake of apoptotic cells by macrophages as shown here,  deficiencies in the early components of the complement  pathway would be predicted to result in impaired clearance  of apoptotic cells. We have recently shown that exposure  to excess numbers of apoptotic cells can induce autoantibody production and glomerular IgG deposition in normal  mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), and Botto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>) detected abnormal numbers  of apoptotic cells in the kidneys of mice deficient in C1q  that develop a lupus-like disease. Taken together, these  findings provide a compelling role for complement in the  clearance of apoptotic cells in vivo and could explain why  humans with early complement component deficiencies  develop SLE. In contrast to patients with defective expression of the common &#x003b2; chain (CD18) who develop recurrent bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), a patient with a selective deficiency of CD11b epitope 17 expression presented with  SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). However, it is unlikely that lack of CD11b alone  is sufficient to develop lupus, as CD11b-deficient mice are  clinically well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>) and our in vitro studies indicate that  both CR3 and CR4 are involved in uptake of apoptotic  cells. In addition, apoptotic cell death could also explain  why complement is activated in diverse pathologies such as  myocardial infarctions, burns, AIDS, and UV irradiation,  where significant numbers of apoptotic cells are produced  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Heat-labile serum  factor(s) augment the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in a concentration-, time-, and temperature-dependent fashion.
