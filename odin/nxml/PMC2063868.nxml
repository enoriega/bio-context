We recently reported that the semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) receptor Plexin-B1 functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for R-Ras, a member of Ras family GTPases implicated in regulation of integrin activity and cell migration (Oinuma, I., Y. Ishikawa, H. Katoh, and M. Negishi. 2004. <italic>Science</italic>. 305:862&#x02013;865). We characterized the role of R-Ras downstream of Sema4D/Plexin-B1 in cell migration. Activation of Plexin-B1 by Sema4D suppressed the ECM-dependent R-Ras activation, R-Ras&#x02013;mediated phosphatydylinositol 3-kinase activation, and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin activation through its R-Ras GAP domain, leading to inhibition of cell migration. In addition, inactivation of R-Ras by overexpression of the R-Ras&#x02013;specific GAP or knockdown of R-Ras by RNA interference was sufficient for suppressing &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin activation and cell migration in response to the ECM stimulation. Thus, we conclude that R-Ras activity is critical for ECM-mediated &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin activation and cell migration and that inactivation of R-Ras by Sema4D/Plexin-B1&#x02013;mediated R-Ras GAP activity controls cell migration by modulating the activity of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; HS, horse serum; PE, phycoerythrin; PI3-K, phosphatydylinositol 3-kinase; WT, wild type.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Semaphorins comprise a large family of secreted and transmembrane molecules that play central roles in axon guidance in the developing nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kolodkin et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tamagnone et al., 1999</xref>). The function of semaphorins is mediated by plexins, which are classified into four subfamilies: Plexin-A, -B, -C, and -D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tamagnone et al., 1999</xref>). Semaphorins were originally identified as repulsive axonal guidance molecules, but they have recently been shown to regulate integrin-mediated cell migration in a variety of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tamagnone and Comoglio, 2004</xref>). Sema3A exerts an essential permissive role in the execution of vasculature remodeling by inhibiting integrin-mediated adhesion of endothelial cells to the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Serini et al., 2003</xref>). Activation of Plexin-B1 negatively regulates integrin-based cell adhesion and migration of NIH-3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barberis et al., 2004</xref>). Plexin-C1 inhibits integrin-mediated adhesion and chemokine-induced migration of dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walzer et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, semaphorin/plexin signaling plays an important role in the migration of a variety of cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition of integrin-mediated cell migration by semaphorins through plexins remain unclear.</p><p>Rho family small GTPases are signal transduction molecules that remodel the actin cytoskeleton and play fundamental roles in numerous cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Negishi and Katoh, 2002</xref>). The small GTPase Rnd1, a constitutively active GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nobes et al., 1998</xref>), is known to interact directly with the cytoplasmic domain of Plexin-B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oinuma et al., 2003</xref>). We recently revealed that Plexin-B1 functions as an R-Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and directly and specifically down-regulates R-Ras activity in response to Sema4D, inducing repulsive response in hippocampal neurons, and that the expression of R-Ras GAP activity of Plexin-B1 requires Rnd1 association with the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oinuma et al., 2004a</xref>). Furthermore, expression of constitutively active R-Ras prevents growth cone collapse induced by Sema4D/Plexin-B1 as well as Sema3A/Plexin-A1, whereas R-Ras siRNA caused a growth cone collapse similar to those induced by semaphorins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oinuma et al., 2004a</xref>).</p><p>Integrins are a family of &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimeric cell surface receptors that bind to the ECM, such as collagens and fibronectins, and play a central part in regulating cell growth, survival, migration, and tumor metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hood and Cheresh, 2002</xref>). Activation of integrins is essential for cell adhesion and cell migration, and several studies show that the Ras family of small GTPases regulates integrin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kinbara et al., 2003</xref>). Among the Ras family GTPases, activated R-Ras was shown to induce integrin activation and increase cell adhesion and matrix assembly, suggesting that R-Ras plays an important role in the regulation of integrin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sethi et al., 1999</xref>). However, how R-Ras activity is regulated and how R-Ras activates integrins remain obscure. Significantly, Sema4D was the first extracellular stimulus shown to influence the activity of R-Ras. These facts collectively prompted us to speculate that plexins regulate integrin-mediated cell migration by their R-Ras GAP activity.</p><p>In this study, we characterized the role of R-Ras downstream of Sema4D/Plexin-B1 in regulation of integrin activation and cell migration. The activation of R-Ras by ECM is required for ECM-mediated integrin activation and cell migration, and Sema4D/Plexin-B1 inhibits integrin activation and cell migration through R-Ras GAP activity. We also revealed that down-regulation of phosphatydylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) activity is responsible for Sema4D/Plexin-B1&#x02013;induced suppression of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin activity and cell migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sema4D antagonizes integrin-mediated cell migration</title><p>We examined the effect of Sema4D on integrin-mediated migration of PC12 cells in a cell migration assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Transwell chambers were coated on the lower side with varying concentrations of collagen I. PC12 cells exhibited a collagen concentration&#x02013;dependent promotion of cell migration, which was antagonized by Sema4D. The collagen-dependent PC12 cell migration is mediated by &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin subunits, as functional blocking antibodies against &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>) and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>) integrin subunits strongly impaired the migration.

We previously reported that Sema4D stimulation down-regulates NGF-stimulated R-Ras activity via the R-Ras GAP activity of Plexin-B1 to induce neurite retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oinuma et al., 2004a</xref>). We next tested whether stimulation of PC12 cells with collagen and Sema4D affects R-Ras activity. PC12 cells were plated onto collagen-coated dishes and lysed, and the lysates were incubated with the GST-fused Ras binding domain of c-Raf-1 (GST-RBD) to pull down activated R-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Rooij and Bos, 1997</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, cells plated on collagen-coated dishes showed a collagen concentration&#x02013;dependent increase in endogenous R-Ras activity, whereas those kept in suspension or plated onto the non&#x02013;integrin-dependent substrate poly-<sc>d</sc>-lysine did not. Furthermore, the collagen-dependent activation of R-Ras was inhibited by a functional blocking antibody against &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins, P5D2, and was enhanced by affinity-related activation of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins by the monoclonal antibody 8A2, which mechanically induces a high-affinity state of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins. These data suggest that &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins are required for R-Ras activation upon ECM-mediated adhesion. Sema4D stimulation strongly inhibited the collagen-induced activation of R-Ras, and affinity-related activation of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins by the 8A2 antibody attenuated the inhibitory effect of Sema4D on ECM-mediated R-Ras activation. R-Ras is known to regulate &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 1996</xref>). To examine the effect of Sema4D on &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin activity, we measured the activity of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins in cells with or without Sema4D stimulation by the immunoprecipitation assay with the monoclonal antibody against active conformations of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins, HUTS-4, which detects hybrid domain swing-out in &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins, a process most commonly associated with ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mould et al., 2003</xref>). Sema4D antagonized the collagen-dependent activation of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Inhibition of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin activity by Sema4D was also observed in the ELISA using the HUTS-4 antibody, which was performed under a detergent-free condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). To further ascertain that Sema4D indeed affects the activity of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins, we performed flow cytometry analysis using the HUTS-4 antibody. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>, cells treated with Sema4D showed a decrease in the level of HUTS-4 binding (FITC staining). Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> treatment, which induces the activation of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins, resulting in the effective interaction with the ECM ligands and increased HUTS-4 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luque et al., 1996</xref>), completely overcame the Sema4D-induced decrease in HUTS-4 binding. These results suggest that decreased HUTS-4 binding induced by Sema4D is due to affinity modulation of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins. FAK is known to be autophosphorylated at tyrosine upon integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hildebrand et al., 1993</xref>), and FAK phosphorylation downstream of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins is the important step for integrin-mediated cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parsons et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sieg et al., 2000</xref>).As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>, Sema4D inhibited the collagen-mediated FAK tyrosine phosphorylation.

COS-7 cells expressing R-Ras&#x02013;wild type (WT) were plated onto fibronectin-coated dishes or nonadherent control dishes and lysed, and the lysates were incubated with GST-RBD to pull down activated R-Ras. The same cell lysates were also used for the immunoprecipitation assay using HUTS-4 for measurement of the activity of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins.

We show that the Sema4D receptor, Plexin-B1, down-regulates R-Ras activity and inhibits ECM-mediated integrin activation and cell migration through its R-Ras GAP activity.</p><p>R-Ras is implicated in integrin regulation, and a constitutively active form of R-Ras has been shown to increase the affinity of integrins for fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 1996</xref>) and to stimulate cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Keely et al., 1999</xref>). We have examined a role of R-Ras in ECM-mediated integrin activation and cell migration and showed that R-Ras is markedly activated by the ECM and that this activation is required for activation of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins and subsequent cell migration, as inactivation of R-Ras activity by expression of the GAP domain of p98&#x02013;R-RasGAP or knockdown of R-Ras by R-Ras&#x02013;specific siRNA markedly reduces ECM-mediated integrin activation and cell migration. Our results also revealed that &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins are required for R-Ras activation upon ECM-mediated adhesion. This suggests a positive feedback during cell-substrate adhesion, implicating R-Ras activation and the consequent further strengthening of integrin-mediated functions. Therefore, R-Ras is a central regulator for ECM-mediated integrin activation and cell migration, and the regulation of R-Ras activity is critical for integrin-mediated cell migration.</p><p>Semaphorins are implicated in migration of a variety of cells. Stimulation of Plexin-B1 by Sema4D is reported to hamper integrin-based adhesion and cell migration in NIH-3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barberis et al., 2004</xref>). We have reported that Plexin-B1 encodes an R-Ras GAP in the cytoplasmic tail and that stimulation of the Plexin-B1&#x02013;Rnd1 complex by Sema4D induces the R-Ras GAP activity and resultant repulsive response of neuronal growth cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oinuma et al., 2004a</xref>). We demonstrate here that Plexin-B1/Rnd1&#x02013;mediated R-Ras GAP activity is also involved in Sema4D-induced inhibition of integrin activation and cell migration. Furthermore, the COOH-terminal PDZ domain binding motif of Plexin-B1 is dispensable for suppression of integrin activity and cell migration by Sema4D. In addition to Sema4D, class 3 semaphorins have been shown to control adhesion and migration of endothelial cells by inhibiting integrin function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Serini et al., 2003</xref>), and Sema3A signaling&#x02013;deficient mice have shown defective migration of neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kawasaki et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, Plexin-C1, a receptor of semaphorin A39R, was recently reported to inhibit integrin-mediated adhesion and chemokine-induced migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walzer et al., 2005</xref>). The R-Ras GAP&#x02013;homologous domains are well conserved among plexin families, including Plexin-A and -C1. In addition, we recently reported that the down-regulation of R-Ras activity is also required for the Sema3A/Plexin-A&#x02013;induced repulsive response in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oinuma et al., 2004a</xref>). We speculate that the direct regulation of R-Ras activity by plexins is likely to be a mutual signaling pathway among plexin families and that this R-Ras GAP activity of plexin families may be a critical signaling system for semaphorin-regulated cell migration.</p><p>Semaphorins were initially identified as repulsive factors for axon guidance, and many neurons use members of the integrin family of cell surface receptors for responses to neurite growth promoting factors, and integrin activation regulates neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hynes, 2002</xref>). Recently, expression of constitutively active R-Ras was shown to promote integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth of retinal neurons, suggesting that R-Ras activity plays an important role in integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ivins et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, it is proposed that the down-regulation of R-Ras activity by Plexin-B1 via R-Ras GAP activity suppresses R-Ras&#x02013;mediated integrin activation and thereby induces growth cone collapse and inhibition of neurite outgrowth. With respect to signaling of other repulsive factors, the ephrin-B1 receptor EphB2, another family of the repulsive factor receptor, was also reported to suppress integrin-mediated functions by inactivating R-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zou et al., 1999</xref>), suggesting that repulsive guidance cues inhibit integrin-mediated functions by inactivating R-Ras in general and that R-Ras acts as a common regulator of integrin activation and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Serini and Bussolino, 2004</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the downstream signaling of Sema4D/Plexin-B1&#x02013;mediated R-Ras GAP activity leading to inactivation of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins and found that down-regulation of PI3-K activity is responsible for Sema4D/Plexin-B1&#x02013;induced suppression of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin activity and cell migration.

Integrin activation by mechanical stretch is also mediated by PI3-K and is followed by an increase in integrin binding to the extracellular matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Katsumi et al., 2005</xref>).

We used the monoclonal antibody HUTS-4, which detects hybrid domain swing-out in &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins, a process most commonly associated with ligand binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mould et al., 2003</xref>), to measure activity of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins and revealed that Sema4D/Plexin-B1&#x02013;mediated R-Ras GAP activity suppresses affinity of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins through inactivation of PI3-K activity. Consistent with our results, a previous report demonstrated that an R-Ras&#x02013;mediated increase in affinity of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins is dependent on PI3-K activity by performing the ligand binding assay in mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kinashi et al., 2000</xref>). On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oertli et al. (2000)</xref> have shown that PI3-K activity is not required for R-Ras&#x02013;mediated integrin activation in CHO cells by using a ligand-mimetic antibody, PAC-1. Therefore, we speculate that this discrepancy may be due to the differences in ways to measure integrin activity or that R-Ras may regulate integrin activity via both PI3-K&#x02013;dependent and &#x02013;independent pathways, depending on the cell type.</p><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that R-Ras activity is required for ECM-mediated integrin activation and cell migration and that the Sema4D/Plexin-B1&#x02013;Rnd1 complex regulates integrin activation and cell migration through the R-Ras GAP activity. However, a variety of molecules such as ErbB-2 and Met have been known to be involved in plexin signaling, inducing diverse physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Swiercz et al., 2004</xref>). It was recently shown that Plexin-B1 enhances chemotaxis of endothelial cells through the activation of multiple intracellular tyrosine kinase cascades independent of the R-Ras GAP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basile et al., 2005</xref>). Regulation of R-Ras activity, tyrosine kinases, and other signaling mechanisms may participate in diverse actions of plexins. Further work will be required to delineate the precise mechanism of R-Ras&#x02013;mediated integrin activation and its regulation by plexins for cell migration during physiological and pathological processes, including neural cell migration, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>DNA constructs and site-directed mutagenesis</title><p>Plexin-B1 cDNA was provided by L.
