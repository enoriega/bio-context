Data were analyzed using GISTIC (Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, which scores the significance of recurrent gains or losses and identifies peak regions likely to contain the driver gene(s).</p><p id="P3">For lung SCC, the most significant amplification peak is located on chromosome segment 3q26.33, with the next most significant peaks encompassing the tyrosine kinase genes <italic>EGFR</italic> on 7p11.2 and <italic>FGFR1</italic> on 8p12 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). In esophageal SCC, the most significant amplification peak spans the cyclin gene <italic>CCND1</italic> on 11q13.2; additional amplifications are found at <italic>EGFR, FGFR1,</italic> chromosome segment 3q26.33 and on 8q24.21 near <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>POU5F1B</italic> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 1</xref>).

As five of the six amplified esophageal SCCs cases were cell lines, we performed fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) on tissue microarrays (TMA) from 63 independent primary esophageal SCC samples and noted amplifications in 7 of 63 cases to confirm recurrent amplifications in primary tumors (data not shown).</p><p id="P5">The peaks on chromosome segment 3q26.33 occur within a previously defined focus of amplification within 3q26-3q28 in SCCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> containing candidate oncogenes including <italic>TP63,</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>

While these results argue that <italic>SOX2</italic> is a target of amplification, the absence of other genes from a GISTIC peak does not exclude an oncogenic role, nor does it exclude polygenic contributions.

Three to ten independent shRNAs were tested and analyzed after introduction into four SCC cell lines (esophageal lines TE10 and TT and lung lines NCI-H520 and HCC95) that harbor 3q26.33 amplification and two control lung adenocarcinoma cell lines that lack 3q26.33 amplification, NCI-H1437 and NCI-H1355.</p><p id="P8">Each shRNA construct was evaluated for its differential impact on proliferation, comparing its effect on the four amplified SCC lines to the two control cell lines.

Analysis with the RIGER<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> algorithm shows that suppression of <italic>SOX2</italic> has the largest differential anti-proliferative effects on the 3q26.33 amplified SCC cell lines among all genes tested (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Since prior work had implicated <italic>DCUN1D1</italic> as a potential transforming oncogene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> we further validated the results of shRNA constructs targeting this gene and noted consistently less effect for knockdown of this gene relative to SOX2 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Note</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 3a&#x02013;b</xref>).

Suppression of <italic>SOX2</italic> with either of two shRNA constructs reduced proliferation in the four 3q26.33-amplified lines but not in controls without appreciable Sox2 expression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). We next evaluated anchorage-independent growth. TE10, TT and NCI-H1355 were not tested as these cell lines fail to form colonies in soft agar.

Further results suggest that the reduction in anchorage-independence upon <italic>SOX2</italic> knockdown exceeds the reduction in proliferation and that <italic>SOX2</italic> is essential for some tumor cells with lower-level copy-gain at 3q26.33 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Note</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 3c&#x02013;d</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To confirm that the effects of <italic>SOX2</italic> shRNA are attributable to <italic>SOX2</italic> suppression, we tested whether we could rescue the effects of suppression of <italic>SOX2</italic> with ectopic wild-type <italic>SOX2</italic> or <italic>SOX2</italic> R74P, a loss-of-function DNA-binding domain mutant identified in a patient with congenital tracheoesophageal fistula<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>.
