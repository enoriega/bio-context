WISH is expressed predominantly in neural tissues and testis. It bound Ash/Grb2 through its proline-rich regions and neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) through its SH3 domain. WISH strongly enhanced N-WASP&#x02013;induced Arp2/3 complex activation independent of Cdc42 in vitro, resulting in rapid actin polymerization. Furthermore, coexpression of WISH and N-WASP induced marked formation of microspikes in Cos7 cells, even in the absence of stimuli. An N-WASP mutant (H208D) that cannot bind Cdc42 still induced microspike formation when coexpressed with WISH. We also examined the contribution of WISH to a rapid actin polymerization induced by brain extract in vitro. Arp2/3 complex was essential for brain extract&#x02013;induced rapid actin polymerization. Addition of WISH to extracts increased actin polymerization as Cdc42 did. However, WISH unexpectedly could activate actin polymerization even in N-WASP&#x02013;depleted extracts. These findings suggest that WISH activates Arp2/3 complex through N-WASP&#x02013;dependent and &#x02013;independent pathways without Cdc42, resulting in the rapid actin polymerization required for microspike formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>N-WASP</kwd><kwd>Arp2/3 complex</kwd><kwd>Ash/Grb2</kwd><kwd>microspike formation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Ash/Grb2 is an adaptor protein composed of one central Src homology (SH) 2 domain and two flanking SH3 domains (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lowensteinetal1992">Lowenstein et al. 1992</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Matuokaetal1992">Matuoka et al. 1992</xref>).

Thus, Ash/Grb2 appears to play important roles not only in mitogenic signaling through Ras activation but also in the reorganization of actin filaments and endocytosis.</p><p>It is already well known that the Rho family of small G protein, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, act as molecular switches by cycling between the active GTP-bound and the inactive GDP-bound states to regulate the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="RidleyandHall1992">Ridley and Hall 1992</xref>). Rho primarily regulates development of actin stress fibers&#x0003b; Rac stimulates formation of lamellipodia or membrane ruffling&#x0003b; and Cdc42 induces the formation of filopodia (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hall1998">Hall 1998</xref>).</p><p>Downstream signals from Ash/Grb2 are found to &#x0201c;cross-talk&#x0201d; with these G proteins, resulting in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Indeed, N-WASP, an Ash/Grb2 binding protein, induces filopodium formation that is dependent on Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mikietal1998a">Miki et al. 1998a</xref>). N-WASP possesses a GTPase-binding domain/Cdc42/Rac interactive binding region (GBD/CRIB) motif through which N-WASP binds directly to the active form of Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mikietal1998a">Miki et al. 1998a</xref>). We have also shown that the verprolin homology domain (V) of N-WASP, which is an actin binding site, is essential for filopodium formation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="MikiandTakenawa1998">Miki and Takenawa 1998</xref>), and the cofilin-like domain (C) and acidic (A) region in the COOH terminus of N-WASP are Arp2/3 complex binding sites (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Rohatgietal1999">Rohatgi et al. 1999</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that Arp2/3 complex is markedly activated by the verplorin homology, cofilin homology, and acidic region (VCA) region of N-WASP. This is the minimal essential region for the activation of Arp2/3 complex. However, the full-length N-WASP protein was found to be a less potent activator of Arp2/3 complex than the VCA protein, suggesting that the VCA region is masked in the full-length protein and is exposed by interaction with other activating factors. Thus far, addition of Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) has been shown to increase the activity of full-length N-WASP to the level induced by VCA protein (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Rohatgietal2000">Rohatgi et al. 2000</xref>).</p><p>Recently, other VCA region&#x02013;containing proteins have been identified and named WASP family verplorin-homologous protein (WAVE)/Scar (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mikietal1998b">Miki et al. 1998b</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Suetsuguetal1999">Suetsugu et al. 1999</xref>). WAVEs appear to function downstream of Rac and induce membrane ruffling. Thus, it has been made clear that WASP and WAVE family proteins can bind and activate Arp2/3 complex through the VCA region, resulting in rapid actin polymerization.</p><p>In this study, we identified a novel Ash/Grb2 binding protein that contains an SH3 domain, SH3 binding proline-rich sequences, and a leucine zipper-like motif. We named this protein WASP interacting SH3 protein (WISH), because WISH binds N-WASP through its SH3 domain. In addition, we demonstrate that WISH further enhances N-WASP&#x02013;induced Arp2/3 complex activation independent of Cdc42 in vitro. Furthermore, coexpression of WISH and N-WASP induces marked formation of microspikes in Cos7 cells even in the absence of stimuli, and an N-WASP mutant (H208D) that cannot bind Cdc42 also induced microspike formation when coexpressed with WISH. Using N-WASP&#x02013;depleted brain extracts, we also showed that WISH has an alternative route in addition to the route via N-WASP, to activate Arp2/3 complex in brain extract&#x02013;induced rapid actin polymerization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Glutathione S-Transferase Fusion Proteins</title><p>Glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)-Ash/Grb2 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mikietal1994">Miki et al. 1994</xref>), GST-AshN, GST-AshC (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Watanabeetal1995">Watanabe et al. 1995</xref>), GST-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) 85-kD subunit (p85) SH3 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Shibasakietal1993">Shibasaki et al. 1993</xref>), PLC&#x003b3;1 SH3 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hommaetal1990">Homma et al. 1990</xref>), GST-Nck SH3 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="MatuokaandTakenawa1998">Matuoka and Takenawa 1998</xref>), GST-Fyn SH3 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mikietal1999">Miki et al. 1999</xref>), and GST-CA (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="MikiandTakenawa1998">Miki and Takenawa 1998</xref>) were purified as described.

Among the novel clones, there was a 2,848-bp cDNA (sequence data available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. AF130313) containing an open reading frame that encodes a 711&#x02013;amino acid protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> A). We named this protein WASP interacting SH3 protein (WISH) because it was found to be an N-WASP activating protein. The predicted amino acid sequence had an SH3 domain at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus and three class II&#x02013;type SH3 binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. B</xref>).

Only immunoprecipitates from Myc-tagged WISH-transfected cell lysates contained Ash/Grb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A, lane 2). The positive signal was specific, as anti-Myc immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with empty vector did not give positive signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A, lane 1). The two bands above the Ash/Grb2 band in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A are the light chains of the anti-Myc antibody. We then examined whether endogenous WISH associates with Ash/Grb2 by immunoprecipitation with anti-WISH antibody using N1E-115 cell lysates. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> B shows that endogenous WISH associated with Ash/Grb2 in N1E-115 cells as well.</p><p>WISH has putative SH3 binding motifs (proline-rich sequences) as described above. To clarify whether these proline-rich sequences in WISH can associate with the SH3 domain of Ash/Grb2, we used a variety of GST fusion proteins of Ash/Grb2 such as full-length Ash/Grb2 (GST-Ash), the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal SH3 domain (GST-AshN), and the COOH-terminal SH3 domain (GST-AshC), and the histidine-tagged proline-rich sequence of WISH (His-Pro, amino acids 132&#x02013;268), and carried out in vitro binding assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> C, both SH3 domains of Ash/Grb2 bound strongly to the proline-rich sequences in WISH. SH3 domains of the 85-kD subunit of PI 3-kinase and PLC&#x003b3;1 also bound to the proline-rich sequences in WISH in vitro (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>WISH Binds to N-WASP via Its SH3 Domain</title><p>To investigate WISH signaling, we searched for WISH binding proteins in N1E-115 cell lysates prelabeled with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine by immunoprecipitation with anti-WISH antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A, several proteins were found to coprecipitate specifically with WISH. Among them, the band at 65 kD was particularly strong. We postulated that this protein was N-WASP, because N-WASP is a 65-kD protein and possesses a proline-rich region that may serve as a target for the WISH SH3 domain. To confirm this possibility, we examined anti-WISH immunoprecipitates with various antibodies against proteins such as Sos, c-Cbl, synaptojanin, and WAVE that contain proline-rich regions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B, only N-WASP was coimmunoprecipitated. Sos, c-Cbl, and synaptojanin were not associated with WISH. Another WASP family protein, WAVE, which also has a proline-rich sequence (<!--No matching bib/@id; no xref created.-->Miki et al.. 1998b), was not coimmunoprecipitated with WISH, suggesting that WISH-SH3 bound specifically to N-WASP. To confirm that the SH3 domain of WISH is required for association with N-WASP, we made various deletion constructs of WISH as GST fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> C) and studied the abilities of these fusion proteins to bind N-WASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> D). As expected, the full-length and SH3 domain of WISH bound N-WASP. Furthermore, it was found that the SH3 domain of WISH (His&#x02013;WISH-SH3, 1&#x02013;132 amino acids) bound the proline-rich region of N-WASP (GST&#x02013;NW-Pro, 265&#x02013;391 amino acids) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> E).</p></sec><sec><title>WISH Further Stimulates N-WASP&#x02013;induced Arp2/3 Complex Activation</title><p>Because WISH bound specifically to N-WASP, we examined whether WISH could further stimulate N-WASP&#x02013;induced Arp2/3 complex activation in vitro. Actin polymerization can be monitored with pyrene-labeled actin, a fluorescent derivative of actin that exhibits higher fluorescence intensity when actin is assembled into filaments. Using a cell-free system, we measured the effect of N-WASP and WISH on Arp2/3 complex&#x02013;induced actin polymerization. All proteins used in this experiment are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A. The GST-VCA fusion protein of N-WASP (VCA) markedly activated Arp2/3 complex&#x02013;induced actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> B) as described previously (<!--No matching bib/@id; no xref created.-->Rohatgi et al.., 1999). In contrast, full-length N-WASP was not as potent as VCA. Addition of GST-Cdc42 fusion protein (Cdc42) to N-WASP in this system increased Arp2/3 complex&#x02013;induced actin polymerization to the level evoked by VCA in the presence of PIP<sub>2</sub> (data not shown), but addition of Cdc42 without PIP<sub>2</sub> did not increase activity to that of VCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> B). Surprisingly, addition of GST-WISH fusion protein (WISH) to N-WASP increased the Arp2/3 complex&#x02013;induced actin polymerization to the level induced by VCA even in the absence of Cdc42. Addition of Cdc42 did not increase activity any further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> B). WISH did not activate Arp2/3 complex directly without N-WASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> B).</p><p>We then checked whether GST fusion proteins of other SH3 proteins such as Ash/Grb2 (Ash), Fyn, Nck, Ash/Grb2 NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal SH3 domain (AshN), p85, and PLC&#x003b3;1 (PLC&#x003b3;) also activate Arp2/3 complex as well. Ash and AshN stimulated N-WASP&#x02013;induced Arp2/3 complex activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> C) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Carlieretal2000">Carlier et al.. 2000</xref>), but they were less effective than WISH. The SH3 domains from Fyn, PLC&#x003b3;, Nck, and p85 also activated N-WASP. However, these SH3 proteins were not as potent as Ash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. D</xref>). In contrast, WISH-SH3 (SH3) caused significant and tremendous activation of N-WASP. Thus, WISH was found to be the strongest activator of N-WASP among the SH3 proteins examined. Interestingly, Cdc42 was not necessary for the activation to the level induced by VCA. This activation was detected only with the SH3 domain of WISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> C). Basic proteins that do not contain SH3 domains, such as myelin basic protein (MBP&#x0003b; Upstate Biotechnology), did not activate N-WASP at all, suggesting that activation was not merely due to ionic interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> C). We further examined the concentration-dependent effect on actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> D). Both SH3 domains of WISH and full-length WISH increased the initial actin polymerization rate in a concentration-dependent manner, and their activation potencies were higher than those of other SH3 domains, such as AshN and Fyn.</p><p>Thus far, it has been thought that the N-WASP VCA region, which is masked under resting conditions, is exposed by binding of Cdc42 to the GBD/CRIB motif of N-WASP. Taken together, these results present the idea that WISH alone can expose the VCA region of N-WASP by binding to the proline-rich region of N-WASP independent of Cdc42.</p></sec><sec><title>Depletion of WISH from Bovine Brain Extracts Decreases Actin Polymerization Activity of Bovine Brain Extracts</title><p>Addition of Cdc42 to extracts of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zigmondetal1998">Zigmond et al. 1998</xref>) or <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Maetal1998">Ma et al. 1998</xref>) induces an increase in actin polymerization. In addition, WASP-dependent actin comets have also been shown to be formed in bovine brain extracts (<!--No matching bib/@id; no xref created.-->Yarar et al. 1999). Thus, we further applied bovine brain extracts instead of purified proteins to examine the involvement of WISH in actin polymerization under a condition that more closely reflects the in vivo situation. Addition of bovine brain extracts induced actin polymerization in the presence of Cdc42. To address whether WISH, N-WASP, or Arp2/3 complex contributes to actin polymerization activity in brain extracts, WISH, N-WASP, and Arp2/3 complex were depleted with anti-WISH antibody, anti&#x02013;N-WASP antibody, and GST-CA protein treatment, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> A). In WISH-depleted extracts, 90% of WISH was removed, whereas N-WASP levels remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> A). Approximately 98% of N-WASP or 95% of Arp2/3 complex was removed in the respective depleted extract. These depleted extracts were used to examine the roles of Arp2/3 complex, N-WASP, and WISH in brain extract&#x02013;induced actin polymerization. Addition of Cdc42 or WISH to mock-treated extracts increased initial actin polymerization markedly, but Fyn SH3 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B, a). On the other hand, the maximal actin polymerization levels that were attained up to 100 min were similar for Mock, Mock + Cdc42, and Mock + WISH (data not shown), suggesting that WISH activates the initial rate of actin polymerization. As expected, Cdc42, WISH, and WISH-SH3 activated the initial actin polymerization rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B, b). Arp2/3 complex was essential for brain extract&#x02013;induced actin polymerization, because addition of Cdc42 or WISH to Arp2/3 complex&#x02013;depleted extracts did not restore activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> C, a and b). Adding back of Arp2/3 complex did restore polymerization activity (data not shown). WISH depletion did not affect basal activity without Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> D, a and b), but addition of excess WISH to WISH-depleted extracts increased actin polymerization activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, Da and Db). N-WASP depletion also did not affect basal actin polymerization activity, but addition of WISH to N-WASP&#x02013;depleted extracts increased the activity significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> E, a and b), although addition of Cdc42 increased the activity only slightly. These findings suggest that WISH activates Arp2/3 complex not only in an N-WASP&#x02013;dependent manner but also in an N-WASP&#x02013;independent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>WISH and N-WASP Induce Microspike Formation Cooperatively In Vivo</title><p>To examine whether WISH stimulates N-WASP&#x02013;induced microspike formation, WISH and N-WASP were coexpressed in Cos7 cells. Expression of WISH or N-WASP alone did not cause any morphological changes in Cos7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> A). In response to EGF stimulation, however, N-WASP&#x02013;expressing cells formed microspikes, whereas WISH-expressing cells did not. When WISH and N-WASP were coexpressed, microspike formation was induced even in the absence of EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> B), though the structure of actin filaments was also altered. To clarify whether Cdc42 is necessary for N-WASP&#x02013;induced microspike formation when WISH is present, we used an N-WASP mutant (H208D) that cannot bind Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mikietal1998a">Miki et al. 1998a</xref>). H208D alone was not able to induce microspike formation even in the presence of EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> C, top panels). However, coexpression of H208D and WISH did induce microspike formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> C, bottom panels). Real-time observation by phase&#x02013;contrast microscopy revealed that these microspikes were filopodia but not retraction fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> D). The numbers of cells that formed microspikes were also increased by coexpression of WISH and N-WASP or WISH and H208D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> E). All these results indicate that WISH alone has an ability to activate N-WASP to induce microspike formation without the aid of Cdc42.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>WISH Is a Novel Adaptor Protein That Activates N-WASP</title><p>WISH is a 90-kD protein that contains one SH3 domain at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus and three SH3 binding sites, which are proline-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. B</xref>). WISH associates with SH3 domains in Ash/Grb2 through these proline-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> C), but it also associates with the SH3 domains of PLC&#x003b3;1, Fyn, Nck, and PI 3-kinase 85-kD subunit in vitro. WISH is probably recruited to the activated receptors for these proteins in response to extracellular stimuli as a downstream molecule in tyrosine kinase signaling. Thus, WISH is thought to act as an adaptor protein that binds to SH3 domains of these proteins.</p><p>The NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of WISH contains an SH3 domain and was shown to form a complex with N-WASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Binding through the WISH-SH3 domain appears to be fairly specific because other proline-rich proteins such as Sos, synaptojanin, c-Cbl, and WAVE, which are all known to bind various SH3 domains, did not bind WISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B). N-WASP can activate Arp2/3 complex through the VCA region at its COOH terminus, resulting in rapid polymerization of actin (<!--No matching bib/@id; no xref created.-->Rohatgi et al.., 1999). The mechanism of N-WASP activation is explained as follows. Under resting conditions, the VCA region essential for Arp2/3 complex activation is masked by an intramolecular interaction with the region containing the GBD/CRIB motif (<!--No matching bib/@id; no xref created.-->Miki et al.. 1998a). When cells are stimulated, activated Cdc42 binds to the GBD/CRIB motif. This leads to the exposure of the VCA region, where G-actin and Arp2/3 complex are recruited. Consequently, actin polymerization is induced in the cortical area of cells, resulting in filopodium formation. Indeed, GST-VCA protein remarkably activates Arp2/3 complex&#x02013;induced actin polymerization, indicating that the VCA region is the minimal essential region for Arp2/3 complex activation. However, it should be noted that activated Cdc42 can only partially activate N-WASP and requires addition of PIP<sub>2</sub> to reach the activation level induced by GST-VCA protein (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Rohatgietal2000">Rohatgi et al. 2000</xref>). We show here that an N-WASP binding protein, WISH, can also expose the VCA region of N-WASP and effectively enhance N-WASP&#x02013;induced Arp2/3 complex activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> B). This activation is mediated by the binding through the SH3 domain of WISH, because the fusion protein containing the SH3 domain also has activating ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> C). Ash/Grb2 SH3 can also activate N-WASP (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Carlieretal2000">Carlier et al.. 2000</xref>) but much less potently than WISH-SH3 did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> C). In addition, other SH3 elements such as the SH3 of Fyn, Nck, PLC&#x003b3;1, and PI 3-kinase 85-kD subunit cause only weak activation of N-WASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> C).</p></sec><sec><title>WISH Activates Arp2/3 Complex&#x02013;induced Actin Polymerization Independent of Cdc42</title><p>More interestingly, WISH enhances N-WASP&#x02013;induced Arp2/3 complex activation to the level of GST-VCA protein even in the absence of Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> B), suggesting that binding of WISH to N-WASP is sufficient for full activation. It is known that brain extracts induce WASP-dependent actin comet formation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Yararetal1999">Yarar et al.. 1999</xref>). In this case, addition of WISH instead of Cdc42 also activates actin polymerization to the level induced by Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B). When WISH is added to N-WASP&#x02013;depleted extracts, such activation is still observed. In contrast, addition of Cdc42 to this system does not restore activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> E). This suggests that WISH activates Arp2/3 complex through both N-WASP&#x02013;dependent and &#x02013;independent pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>) and that Cdc42 is not required for either pathway if WISH is present.</p><p>WASP and N-WASP also bind several proteins such as WIP and proline serine threonine phosphatase interacting protein (PSTPIP) (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Rameshetal1997">Ramesh et al.. 1997</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Wuetal1998">Wu et al.. 1998</xref>). These proteins may have N-WASP&#x02013;activating activity as well, though their effects on N-WASP&#x02013;induced activation of Arp2/3 complex have not been examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible Roles of WISH in Neuronal Cells</title><p>Both WISH and N-WASP are expressed predominantly in brain and neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mikietal1996">Miki et al. 1996</xref>).

However, the precise functions of WISH in neural cells remain to be clarified.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Toshihiko Suzuki and Dr. Chihiro Sasakawa (Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo) for providing antibody against Arp3.
