In this study, we demonstrate an essential role for protein&#x02013;tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)&#x02013;1B in this process. In resting platelets, c-Src forms a complex with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 and Csk, which phosphorylates c-Src tyrosine 529 to maintain c-Src autoinhibition. Fibrinogen binding to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 triggers PTP-1B recruitment to the &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3&#x02013;c-Src&#x02013;Csk complex in a manner that is dependent on c-Src and specific tyrosine (tyrosine 152 and 153) and proline (proline 309 and 310) residues in PTP-1B. Studies of PTP-1B&#x02013;deficient mouse platelets indicate that PTP-1B is required for fibrinogen-dependent Csk dissociation from &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3, dephosphorylation of c-Src tyrosine 529, and c-Src activation. Furthermore, PTP-1B&#x02013;deficient platelets are defective in outside-in &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 signaling in vitro as manifested by poor spreading on fibrinogen and decreased clot retraction, and they exhibit ineffective Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and thrombus formation in vivo. Thus, PTP-1B is an essential positive regulator of the initiation of outside-in &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 signaling in platelets.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviation used in this paper: PTP, protein&#x02013;tyrosine phosphatase.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Integrins mediate cell adhesion to extracellular matrix ligands. In addition to localizing cells for proper biological function, ligand binding to integrins initiates a process referred to as outside-in signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hynes, 2002</xref>). Integrin signals collaborate with signals from growth factor, cytokine, and G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors to regulate actin rearrangements and cell motility, growth, differentiation, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Juliano et al., 2004</xref>). Because the cytoplasmic domains of integrin &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits are devoid of catalytic activity, integrins must associate with intracellular enzymes to transduce signals. Associations between integrins and specific receptor and nonreceptor protein kinases have been demonstrated by biochemical, microscopic, and biophysical techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brunton et al., 2004</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Virgilio et al., 2004</xref>). However, many of these associations take place relatively late after adhesive ligand binding, suggesting that they propagate rather than initiate outside-in signaling. One exception is in platelets, in which a constitutive association between integrin &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 and c-Src is mediated by direct interaction of the &#x003b2;3 cytoplasmic domain with the c-Src SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Obergfell et al., 2002</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Salgado et al., 2003</xref>). A similar relationship may pertain to c-Src and the related integrin, &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3, in osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, in many cell types, a close functional, if not physical, relationship exists between Src family kinases and &#x003b2;1 or &#x003b2;2 integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klinghoffer et al., 1999</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Suen et al., 1999</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brunton et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>&#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 mediates fibrinogen-dependent platelet aggregation and spreading on damaged vascular surfaces, whereas &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 promotes osteoclast adhesion to vitronectin or osteopontin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byzova et al., 1998</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shattil and Newman, 2004</xref>). Genetic deficiency of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 and &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 leads to defects in hemostasis and bone remodeling, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hodivala-Dilke et al., 1999</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2001</xref>). Adhesive ligand binding to &#x003b2;3 integrins leads to c-Src activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src substrates in platelets and osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2001</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Obergfell et al., 2002</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Salgado et al., 2003</xref>). The close relationship between &#x003b2;3 integrins and c-Src is underscored by defective spreading of platelets that are deficient in multiple Src family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Obergfell et al., 2002</xref>) and by overlapping bone remodeling phenotypes in mice that are deficient in c-Src or &#x003b2;3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Soriano et al., 1991</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hodivala-Dilke et al., 1999</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McHugh et al., 2000</xref>). Consequently, attention is now focused on how &#x003b2;3 integrins regulate c-Src to initiate outside-in signaling.</p><p>c-Src is maintained in an autoinhibited state by concerted intramolecular interactions of the SH2 domain with a COOH-terminal motif centered at phosphotyrosine 529 and of the SH3 domain with a polyproline sequence in the linker region between the SH2 and kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sicheri and Kuriyan, 1997</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Young et al., 2001</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrison, 2003</xref>). As c-Src appears to associate constitutively with &#x003b2;3 integrins via the c-Src SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Salgado et al., 2003</xref>), considerable reliance may be placed on the SH2&#x02013;phosphotyrosine 529 interaction to help maintain low c-Src activity in nonadherent platelets. Thus, disruption of the SH2&#x02013;phosphotyrosine 529 interaction by dephosphorylation of c-Src tyrosine 529 should facilitate c-Src activation during cell adhesion. Phosphorylation of c-Src tyrosine 529 is catalyzed by Csk, which is associated with the &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3&#x02013;c-Src complex in resting platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okada et al., 1991</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Obergfell et al., 2002</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Salgado et al., 2003</xref>). However, the identity of the protein&#x02013;tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that dephosphorylates c-Src tyrosine 529 to promote initiation of &#x003b2;3 integrin signaling has remained unknown. In this study, we used biochemical and genetic approaches to unambiguously identify PTP-1B, which is a ubiquitous nonreceptor tyrosine phosphatase, as a phosphatase that is required for dephosphorylation of c-Src tyrosine 529 and for c-Src activation downstream of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3. Moreover, we demonstrate that PTP-1B is required for outside-in signaling in platelets and for normal platelet thrombus formation in living mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PTP-1B associates with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 and is required for integrin activation of c-Src</title><p>To explore how &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 regulates c-Src, we sought to identify a PTP that localizes to the &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3&#x02013;c-Src complex in response to fibrinogen binding to platelets. We reasoned that this might reverse phosphorylation of c-Src tyrosine 529 by Csk and, thereby, help to promote c-Src activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Obergfell et al., 2002</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Salgado et al., 2003</xref>). A previous study has demonstrated that PTP-1B is localized to internal membranes of resting platelets and is cleaved by calpain in a platelet aggregation&#x02013;dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frangioni et al., 1993</xref>). We found that PTP-1B coimmunoprecipitated with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 and c-Src from detergent lysates of human and mouse platelets. However, unlike the associations of c-Src and Csk with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3, which are observed in resting platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Obergfell et al., 2002</xref>), the association of PTP-1B with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 and c-Src required fibrinogen binding to platelets. This was induced either by MnCl<sub>2</sub>, which activates &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 directly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Litvinov et al., 2004</xref>), or by plating the cells on fibrinogen (not depicted). PTP-1B recruitment to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 in response to MnCl<sub>2</sub> and fibrinogen did not require PTP-1B cleavage by calpain because platelet aggregation was avoided under these unstirred conditions, and no such cleavage was observed. The interaction of PTP-1B with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 was specific and was observed whether immunoprecipitation was performed with antibodies to PTP-1B or &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> b). The interactions of PTP-1B with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 and c-Src were prevented by pretreatment of platelets with 2 &#x003bc;M SU6656 or 5 &#x003bc;M PP2 to block Src kinase activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a) or with 2 mM RGDS (Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser) to inhibit fibrinogen binding.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Interactions between PTP-1B, &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3, and c-Src in platelets.</bold> (a) Washed human platelets were incubated for 15 min at RT with 250 &#x003bc;g/ml fibrinogen in the presence or absence of 0.5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>.

However, in the studies that follow, MnCl<sub>2</sub> or platelet adhesion were used to induce fibrinogen binding to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 to prevent or minimize generalized signaling via G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors and, thus, to facilitate direct assessment of outside-in &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Obergfell et al., 2002</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Salgado et al., 2003</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that fibrinogen binding to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 triggers recruitment of PTP-1B to a plasma membrane complex of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 and c-Src in a manner that is dependent on Src kinase activity.</p><p>To establish whether PTP-1B is required for integrin activation of c-Src, platelets from knockout mice that were deficient in PTP-1B (PTP-1B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) and wild-type (PTP-1B<sup>+/+</sup>) littermates were studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klaman et al., 2000</xref>). Incubation of wild-type platelets with MnCl<sub>2</sub> and fibrinogen caused an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous proteins. In contrast, PTP-1B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets showed markedly reduced fibrinogen-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> c). Because several of the phosphorylated proteins, including Syk (72 kD) and adhesion and degranulation-promoting adaptor protein (130 kD), are substrates of c-Src during outside-in &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 signaling, the catalytic activity of c-Src in &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 immunoprecipitates was assessed indirectly by monitoring the phosphorylation of activation loop tyrosine 418. Whereas fibrinogen binding to PTP-1B<sup>+/+</sup> platelets stimulated phosphorylation of c-Src tyrosine 418, this response was minimal or absent in PTP-1B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, c and e</xref>). Platelets from heterozygous (PTP-1B<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup>) littermates responded normally (not depicted). The defective responses of PTP-1B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets could not be explained by reduced surface expression of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 receptors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> d). These results suggest that PTP-1B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets have a fundamental defect in &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation of c-Src.</p><p>To determine whether PTP-1B is required for fibrinogen-dependent dephosphorylation of c-Src tyrosine 529, the phosphorylation state of tyrosine 529 was monitored with an antibody specific for nonphosphorylated tyrosine 529. Whereas fibrinogen binding to wild-type platelets stimulated dephosphorylation of c-Src tyrosine 529 (as indicated by increased immunoreactivity of the dephosphotyrosine 529 antibody), no such dephosphorylation was observed in PTP-1B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets. In fact, the level of tyrosine 529 phosphorylation paradoxically increased upon fibrinogen binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> e). Thus, PTP-1B is required for &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3-dependent dephosphorylation of c-Src tyrosine 529, likely explaining the defective activation of c-Src in PTP-1B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets.</p><p>The finding of relatively increased phosphorylation of c-Src tyrosine 529 in fibrinogen-bound PTP-1B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets suggested that PTP-1B may play some unexpected role in the phosphorylation of tyrosine 529 by Csk. Csk is normally associated with the &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3&#x02013;c-Src complex in resting platelets and dissociates from it upon fibrinogen binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Obergfell et al., 2002</xref>). However, Csk failed to fully dissociate from &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 and c-Src after fibrinogen binding to PTP-1B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> f). Thus, PTP-1B may not only dephosphorylate c-Src tyrosine 529 upon fibrinogen binding to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arregui et al., 1998</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dadke and Chernoff, 2002</xref>) but may also regulate the interaction between Csk and the &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3&#x02013;c-Src complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism of PTP-1B&#x02013;&#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3&#x02013;c-Src interactions</title><p>To better understand the basis for interactions between PTP-1B, &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3, and c-Src during outside-in &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 signaling, mouse fibroblasts that were deficient in the ubiquitous Src family kinases c-Src, c-Yes, and Fyn (SYF cells&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klinghoffer et al., 1999</xref>) were stably transfected with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3.

However, PTP-1B failed to associate with c-Src in cells lacking &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 or with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 in cells lacking c-Src. Thus, the fibrinogen-dependent interaction of PTP-1B with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 or c-Src requires both integrin and tyrosine kinase.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Structural features of c-Src that are required for interactions with PTP-1B and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3.</bold> (a) SYF cells or SYF cells stably expressing human &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 (&#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3-SYF) were transiently transfected with wild-type c-Src or empty vector.

In contrast, c-Src tyrosine 529 (Y529F) and the c-Src SH2 domain (&#x00394;150&#x02013;246) were dispensable for the interaction of PTP-1B with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> b).

Wild-type PTP-1B and two different phosphatase-inactive &#x0201c;substrate-trapping&#x0201d; mutants (C215S and D181A) each interacted with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 and c-Src (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> a). Interestingly, the interaction with c-Src was somewhat greater with the D181A PTP-1B mutant, which is known to exhibit a higher affinity for binding to PTP-1B substrates than the C215S mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flint et al., 1997</xref>). These data are consistent with a direct dephosphorylation of c-Src tyrosine 529 by PTP-1B. In contrast to substrate-trapping mutants, the double mutation of proline 309 and 310 to alanine prevented PTP-1B interaction with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 and c-Src, as did the double mutation of tyrosine 152 and 153 to phenylalanine. These amino acid residues may help to mediate interactions of PTP-1B with one or more members of the integrin signaling complex during the early phase of outside-in signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dadke and Chernoff, 2002</xref>). In addition, they may enable the phosphorylation of PTP-1B by c-Src because PTP-1B can phosphorylate c-Src in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jung et al., 1998</xref>), and fibrinogen binding to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3-SYF cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> b) or platelets (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> c) stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP-1B in a Src-dependent manner.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Structural features of PTP-1B that are required for interactions with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 and c-Src.</bold> (a) &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3-SYF cells were transiently cotransfected with c-Src and wild-type or mutant forms of HA-tagged human PTP-1B.

In particular, c-Src, the most abundant Src family member that is expressed in platelets, can bind directly to the integrin &#x003b2;3 subunit, and fibrinogen binding to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 triggers c-Src activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Obergfell et al., 2002</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Salgado et al., 2003</xref>). We sought to determine the mechanism by which fibrinogen binding leads to c-Src activation and explore the physiological significance of this process.

In fact, receptor tyrosine phosphatases such as RPTP-&#x003b1; or nonreceptor phosphatases such as Shp2 promote outside-in integrin signaling in fibroblasts, in some cases by dephosphorylating c-Src tyrosine 529 or the equivalent residue in another Src family kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oh et al., 1999</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Su et al., 1999</xref>). Although PTP-1B has been implicated in &#x003b2;1 integrin&#x02013;dependent c-Src activation, this has been observed only in immortalized fibroblasts and not in a primary cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2001</xref>), raising the question as to its physiological significance. Our data establish the in vivo relevance of PTP-1B activation of c-Src downstream of a &#x003b2;3 integrin. PTP-1B may also exert negative regulation of integrin signaling by dephosphorylating c-Src substrates such as p130 Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arregui et al., 1998</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 1998</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2001</xref>). Multiple substrates for PTP-1B may exist in platelets, although our results indicate that the dominant action of PTP-1B is the positive regulation of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 signaling through activation of integrin-associated c-Src. In contrast to these results for PTP-1B, platelets from motheaten viable mice that were deficient in Shp1 catalytic function displayed normal &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3-dependent activation of c-Src (unpublished data) and a morphology upon attachment to fibrinogen that is similar to wild-type platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2004</xref>&#x0003b; unpublished data).</p><p>The fibrinogen-dependent association of PTP-1B with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 was observed in human and mouse platelets and in a fibroblast model system, enabling examination of its structural basis. PTP-1B recruitment to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 required catalytic competence and the SH3 domain of c-Src (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Moreover, specific proline (proline 309 and 310) and tyrosine (tyrosine 152 and 153) residues in PTP-1B were necessary (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that a protein (or proteins) with SH3, SH2, and/or phosphotyrosine-binding domains is involved in mediating linkage of PTP-1B to the integrin complex. Although the linker protein in platelets could be c-Src itself, there is no evidence that the c-Src SH2 domain binds to PTP-1B, and the c-Src SH3 domain may not be available to PTP-1B when it engages the integrin &#x003b2;3 cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Salgado et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, a model is proposed in which PTP-1B is localized in resting platelets to internal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frangioni et al., 1993</xref>). Then, fibrinogen binding induces &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simmons et al., 1997</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buensuceso et al., 2003</xref>), triggering transautophosphorylation of integrin-associated c-Src. This event might not be sufficient for full c-Src activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrison, 2003</xref>), but low level activation might enable c-Src to phosphorylate a protein that is capable of recruiting PTP-1B to the &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 complex. After recruitment, PTP-1B may become a substrate for c-Src (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, b and c</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jung et al., 1998</xref>) and induce further c-Src activation by promoting Csk dissociation from the integrin complex and dephosphorylation of tyrosine 529 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> f).</p><p>Although additional studies will be required to determine the mode of PTP-1B linkage to the &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 complex in platelets, work in other cells has implicated scaffold or adaptor molecules, such as SHPS-1, PAG/Cbp, and Dok-1, in mediating interactions between Src kinases, PTPs, and/or Csk in response to growth factors or cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Timms et al., 1999</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dube et al., 2004</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). However, SHPS-1 is poorly expressed in platelets, and PAG/Cbp does not interact with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wonerow et al., 2002</xref>). Intriguingly, Dok-1 contains a phosphotyrosine-binding domain and potential SH2-binding sites and is a substrate for PTP-1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dube et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, Dok-1 binds directly to Csk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shah and Shokat, 2002</xref>) and may associate with integrin &#x003b2; cytoplasmic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calderwood et al., 2003</xref>). Dok-2, a homologue of Dok-1, is expressed in platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garcia et al., 2004</xref>). In preliminary studies, we have found that Dok-2 coimmunoprecipitates with PTP-1B from resting platelets. In addition, fibrinogen binding to platelets stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-2, dissociation of Dok-2 from PTP-1B, and its association with Csk (unpublished data). However, a role for Dok-2 or any other Csk-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas et al., 1999</xref>) in regulating PTP-1B recruitment to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 and outside-in signaling remains to be determined.</p><p>Altogether, these studies have established a new function for PTP-1B by uncovering requirements for PTP-1B in integrin-dependent c-Src activation, platelet spreading on fibrinogen, and clot retraction and platelet thrombus formation. Defects in both platelet spreading and clot retraction may be adequately explained by the c-Src activation defect in PTP-1B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets because both responses require outside-in &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Phillips et al., 2001</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shattil and Newman, 2004</xref>). However, although thrombus formation under flow conditions depends on signaling inputs from multiple platelet receptors, including &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruggeri, 2002</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jackson et al., 2003</xref>), it is legitimate to ask whether the impairment of c-Src activation in PTP-1B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets is the cause of defects in platelet calcium mobilization and thrombus formation, which were observed in the microcirculation of PTP-1B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Although we cannot exclude the possibility of additional unstudied signaling pathways that are affected by a deficiency of PTP-1B, we found no defect in agonist-induced &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation, platelet aggregation, or agonist costimulation of platelet spreading. Furthermore, the ligation of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 is known to induce calcium transients that are required for the formation of stable platelet aggregates under conditions of flow and wall shear stress, which are typical within arterioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mazzucato et al., 2002</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nesbitt et al., 2002</xref>). In particular, IP<sub>3</sub> production and calcium mobilization are triggered by Src-dependent activation of phospholipase C&#x003b3; during outside-in &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wonerow et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, links between defective integrin activation of c-Src and reduced calcium mobilization provide a plausible explanation for the reduced thrombus formation observed in PTP-1B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>In contrast to the reduced platelet thrombus formation in cremasteric vessels of PTP-1B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, there was no spontaneous bleeding, although rebleeding from tail bleeding time wounds was more frequent than in control mice. Thus, the degree of any abnormality in hemostasis imposed by PTP-1B deficiency may be dictated by the type, location, and extent of vascular injury. The same might be true in the case of pharmacological inhibition of PTP-1B. Interestingly, one PTP-1B antagonist of questionable specificity has been shown to reverse platelet aggregation that is stimulated by cross-linking the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ragab et al., 2003</xref>). Although the selectivity of PTP-1B antagonists is still an issue, they are being evaluated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity because PTP-1B negatively regulates insulin and leptin receptor signaling in nonhematopoietic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elchebly et al., 1999</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klaman et al., 2000</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2002</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zabolotny et al., 2002</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tonks, 2003</xref>&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hooft van Huijsduijnen et al., 2004</xref>).
