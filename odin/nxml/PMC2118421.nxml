Previous studies demonstrate that Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP)1 is essential in T cell receptor&#x02013;mediated Ras-Erk activation. Here, we report that RasGRP1 plays an important role in Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI-mediated PI3K activation and mast cell function.

Consequently, activation of Akt, PIP<sub>3</sub>-dependent kinase, and protein kinase C &#x003b4; was defective. Expression of a constitutively active form of N-Ras could rescue the degranulation defect and Akt activation. We further demonstrated that RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mast cells were defective in granule translocation, microtubule formation, and RhoA activation.

As a member of the immune receptor superfamily, the Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI is composed of IgE-binding &#x003b1; subunit and signal-transducing &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Upon cross-linking of the Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI, the Src family protein tyrosine kinase Lyn is activated and phosphorylates the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of the &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits leading to recruitment of Syk. Syk is then activated and further phosphorylates linker for activation of T cells (LAT), SLP-76, and several other signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>).</p><p>Upon phosphorylation, LAT assembles a complex of signaling proteins containing Grb2, Gads, SLP-76, and phospholipase C (PLC)&#x003b3;1/&#x003b3;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Recruitment of Sos to LAT by Grb2 likely leads to activation of the Ras&#x02013;mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Binding of PLC&#x003b3; to LAT is necessary for activation of PLC&#x003b3;. PLC&#x003b3; catalyzes the generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG), which are responsible for inducing calcium influx and protein kinase C (PKC) activation, respectively. In the absence of LAT, signaling pathways downstream of the Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI are impaired. The phosphorylation of SLP-76 and PLC&#x003b3;1/&#x003b3;2 as well as calcium flux are significantly reduced. Consequently, mast cell degranulation and cytokine production are severely affected in LAT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>).</p><p>After Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI aggregation, another Src family kinase, Fyn, is also activated and phosphorylates Gab2. After phosphorylation, Gab2 binds the p85 subunit of phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K). Studies using Gab2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mast cells show that Gab2 is essential for PI3K activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). However, it is not clear how PI3K is activated after recruitment to the plasma membrane by Gab2. Previous data show that in platelet-derived growth factor receptor&#x02013;mediated signaling, GTP-bound Ras is capable of activating PI3K by binding to the p110 catalytic subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). After PI3K activation, phosphatidyl inositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>)-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is relocated to the membrane by binding to PIP<sub>3</sub> and activated through intermolecular auto-phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). PDK1 then phosphorylates and activates Akt and PKC&#x003b4;. Fyn-deficient mast cells have impaired PI3K activation and degranulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), indicating that the Fyn-initiated pathway is important in mast cell degranulation. Recent studies show that cytoskeleton rearrangement, which is regulated by the PI3K pathway, is required for granule translocation and mast cell degranulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). It has been suggested that degranulation is a two-step process: granule translocation to the plasma membrane and granule&#x02013;plasma membrane fusion. Although granule translocation requires Fyn/Gab2, RhoA, and microtubule formation, granule&#x02013;plasma membrane fusion is calcium dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing proteins (RasGRPs) are a family of proteins that contain a DAG-binding C1 domain, a Ras exchange motif domain, two EF-hands, and a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). After PLC&#x003b3; activation, RasGRPs are recruited to the plasma membrane by binding to DAG for subsequent activation of Ras family proteins. Among the four RasGRP proteins, RasGRP1 has been shown to play an important role in TCR signaling and T cell development. T cell development is partially blocked at the double-positive stage in RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Thymocytes from these mice show a complete lack of Erk activation in response to PMA, a DAG analogue, or TCR cross-linking, demonstrating that RasGRP1 links the TCR to Ras signaling. It has been suggested that RasGRP1 interacts with and activates Ras in the Golgi instead of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). RasGRP2 is a candidate oncogene causing leukemia and regulates platelet activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). RasGRP3 is preferentially expressed in B cells. It is phosphorylated after BCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). It has been demonstrated in the DT40 cell line that RasGRP3 is required for optimal activation of Erk upon BCR cross-linking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). RasGRP4 is a new member of the RasGRP family. It is highly expressed in myeloid cells, including mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). It is not known whether RasGRP4 functions in mast cells.</p><p>Despite the fact that RasGRP1 plays an essential role in TCR-mediated Ras-MAPK activation, whether it functions in Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI-mediated signaling in mast cells has not been explored. In this study, we demonstrate that RasGRP1 plays an important role in Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI-mediated PI3K activation and mast cell function.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Expression of RasGRP1 in mast cells</title><p>To assess the potential function of RasGRP1 in mast cells and allergic responses, we first examined whether RasGRP1 is expressed in mast cells. Bone marrow&#x02013;derived mast cells (BMMCs) were derived from the bone marrow cells from WT and RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. After growing in medium with IL-3 for 3 wk, &#x0003e;99% of cultured cells were c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells expressed similar levels of c-Kit and Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI as WT cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), suggesting that RasGRP1 is dispensable for mast cell differentiation and maturation in vitro. These mast cells were used for detection of RasGRP1 protein and subsequent biochemical and functional assays. To detect RasGRP1 expression, lysates of WT and RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mast cells were subjected to anti-RasGRP1 immunoprecipitation. Lysates from WT and RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes were used as controls. The total lysates and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by an anti-RasGRP1 Western blot. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, RasGRP1 protein was clearly detected in WT BMMCs, although not as abundant as in thymocytes. We also examined the expression of RasGRP4 by Western blotting with anti-RasGRP4 antibodies. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), mast cells expressed high amounts of RasGRP4, which was not detected in thymocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>RasGRP1 in Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI-mediated degranulation.</bold> (A) Expression of c-Kit and Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI in WT and RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMCs.

As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI-evoked degranulation was markedly impaired in RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMCs. This defect was not due to their inability to degranulate because thapsigargin, a calcium ATPase inhibitor, was capable of inducing RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMCs to degranulate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). To determine whether granule formation was normal in RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mast cells, we stained mast cells with toluidine blue. Similar granules were seen in WT and RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (not depicted). Thus, defective signaling after Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI engagement likely caused the diminished degranulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Impaired cytokine production in RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMCs</title><p>Upon Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI cross-linking, mast cells secrete cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF&#x003b1;, IL-3, and IL-4.

The concentration of histamine released into the blood was then measured to evaluate IgE-initiated allergic response. A dramatic reduction (&#x0003e;95%) in histamine release was observed in RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared with that in WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether the severe defect in systemic anaphylaxis was due to a developmental defect of mast cells in RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we determined the distribution of mast cells in RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

Similar percentages of mast cells were also detected in peritoneal cavities using toluidine blue staining and flow cytometry analysis. Normal numbers of mast cells in RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice indicated that RasGRP1 is not required during mast cell development and excluded the possibility that the defective anaphylaxis is a consequence of mast cell developmental defects.

Genetic inactivation of the p110&#x003b4; isoform of PI3K leads to defective mast cell development and reduced IgE-induced degranulation and cytokine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). We asked whether RasGRP1 could be involved in the activation of the PI3K pathway in Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI-evoked signaling. To assess the effect of RasGRP1 deficiency on PI3K activation, we first assayed the PI3K activity by determining production of PIP<sub>3</sub> after Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI stimulation. <sup>32</sup>P-labeled mast cells were stimulated with DNP-HSA for 0, 2, 5, and 10 min, and lipid fractions were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography.

The residual PI3K activity in RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMCs might be due to the compensation of RasGRP1 function by other members of the RasGRP family. A previous study has shown that the membrane recruitment of PI3K by Gab2 is required for its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). We examined Gab2 phosphorylation and its interaction with p85. Gab2 was phosphorylated normally and interacted with p85 in RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMMCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>), suggesting that RasGRP1 likely controls PI3K activation through a mechanism other than regulating its membrane recruitment by Gab2.

Overall, tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, phosphorylation of LAT and PLC&#x003b3;1/&#x003b3;2, and calcium influx were intact in RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mast cells. Calcium influx in mast cells is dependent on LAT, SLP-76, and PLC&#x003b3;. LAT or SLP76 deficiency causes a marked decrease of PLC&#x003b3; phosphorylation and calcium flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). RasGRP proteins are activated after binding to DAG, a product of PLC&#x003b3; hydrolysis. Thus, it was not surprising that RasGRP1 deficiency did not affect Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI-mediated proximal signaling and calcium mobilization. Although PI3K lipid products are important for optimal recruitment and activation of PLC&#x003b3;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>), as well as Tec family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), their importance in Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI-mediated calcium mobilization is not entirely clear. Mast cells deficient in Gab2 or Fyn, two critical molecules in Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI-mediated PI3K activation, only have slightly reduced calcium flux. It is possible that in mast cells, Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI-mediated PLC&#x003b3; activation and calcium mobilization are mainly dependent on recruitment of PLC&#x003b3; to the plasma membrane by LAT. Normal PLC&#x003b3; phosphorylation and calcium mobilization in RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mast cells suggested that DAG production is likely normal in these cells. Defective PI3K activation and mast cell function were less likely due to failed DAG production because PMA-induced activation of Akt, PKC&#x003b4;, and PDK1 was still diminished (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>RasGRP1 deficiency affects Ras-Erk activation in the TCR signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), but not in the Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI pathway based on our data here. Normal activation of Erk in RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mast cells suggested that Sos or other RasGRP family members might play a major role in Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI-mediated Ras-Erk activation. Even though we showed that RasGRP1 was expressed in BMMCs, its abundance was not as high as in T cells. RasGRP4 is a new member of the RasGRP family and is highly expressed in mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). C3H/HeJ mice express a unique isoform of RasGRP4 due to an aberrant splicing. This aberrant splicing produces a dysfunctional protein that lacks a DAG-binding domain (C1 domain). These mice are hyporesponsive to methacholine stimulation via the airway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), suggesting that RasGRP4 may have an important role in mast cell function, although other genes in these mice can also contribute to the hyporesponsiveness. We speculate that RasGRP4 might play a similar role in mast cells as RasGRP1 in T cells in Ras-Erk activation. It is also possible that Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI-mediated Erk activation might be independent of RasGRP proteins. In mast cells, Shc is phosphorylated upon Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Through binding to the phosphorylated Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; chains, Shc might recruit the Grb2&#x02013;Sos complex to the plasma membrane to initiate Ras-MAPK activation.</p><p>Published studies have indicated that PI3K is important in mast cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Gene inactivation or pharmacological inhibition of PI3K impairs Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI-mediated degranulation and cytokine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Recruitment of the p85 subunit of PI3K by Gab2 is required for its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). However, the mechanism underlying how PI3K is directly activated after its localization to membrane has not been clearly characterized in mast cells. Our data suggested that full activation of PI3K after Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI engagement requires not only membrane recruitment of p85 by Gab2, but also activation by RasGRP1. Our results indicated that RasGRP1 is likely involved in PI3K activation through N-Ras. The constitutively active form of N-Ras could rescue defective Akt activation and degranulation. GTP-bound Ras has been shown to interact with the p110 subunit of PI3K and induce its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Efficient PI3K activation in platelet-derived growth factor&#x02013;induced signaling requires the function of Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Because RasGRP1 deficiency did not affect Gab2 phosphorylation and the recruitment of p85, it is likely that RasGRP1 activates N-Ras, which further induces PI3K activation through its interaction with p110 in Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI signaling (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). It is not clear why RasGRP1 is only involved in the activation of N-Ras, not K-Ras or H-Ras. Despite the structural similarities among these Ras proteins, their differential posttranslational modifications target them to different microdomains at the membrane or subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Recent studies suggest that upon T cell activation, RasGRP1 translocates to the Golgi apparatus to activate Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Subsequent studies show that N-Ras is activated upon engagement of the TCR and PLC&#x003b3;1 activation, and RasGRP1 may activate N-Ras in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). It remains to be determined whether activation of N-Ras by RasGRP1 in mast cells occurs in the Golgi or the plasma membrane.</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>A proposed model of RasGRP1 in Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI-mediated signaling.</bold> Upon Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI cross-linking and PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis, RasGRP1 is recruited to the membrane by DAG to activate N-Ras.

Why RasGRP1 is required for the Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI pathway, but not the IL-3&#x02013; or SCF-mediated pathway, is not clear.

It is not clear which GEF specifically activates Rac1 and RhoA. In RasGRP1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, Rac1 activation was relatively normal, whereas RhoA activation was reduced. It is possible that RasGRP1 activates the PI3K pathway, which in turns activates a specific GEF for RhoA, although we cannot exclude the possibility that RasGRP1 is also an exchange factor for RhoA in the Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI signaling pathway.</p><p>Lyn and Fyn activate two independent pathways upon engagement of the Fc<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>RI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).

Cells were stimulated with 30 ng/ml DNP-HSA to induce calcium flux. The fluorescence emission ratio at 405&#x02013;495 nm was monitored by flow cytometry. For cytokine production, 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> anti-DNP IgE sensitized cells were stimulated with DNP-HSA for 1 h for RT-PCR and for 8 h for the measurement of cytokines released into supernatants using a Bio-Plex cytokine assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). PIP<sub>3</sub> production was determined using a protocol described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Ras, Rac1, and RhoA activation.</title><p>For Ras activation, 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>/ml mast cells were lysed in a buffer containing 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>. The lysates were incubated with 20 &#x003bc;g GST-Raf-RBD on glutathione beads for 40 min. Beads were washed and boiled in 1&#x000d7; SDS sample buffer. GST-Rhotekin RBD and GST-PAK-PBD fusion protein were provided by K. Burridge (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Rac1 and RhoA activation was examined by pull-down assays as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). GTP-bound pan-Ras, H-Ras, K-Ras, N-Ras, Rac1, and RhoA were detected by Western blotting with antibodies against each of these proteins, respectively.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Ras reconstitution by retroviral transduction.</title><p>Constitutively active forms (G12V) of H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras with an HA tag were subcloned into a retroviral vector, pMSCV/IRES/Bla. The retroviral plasmids were used to transfect Phoenix cells for retrovirus packaging. 12-d-old BMMCs were transduced with retroviruses by spin infection. 48 h after transduction, cells were selected with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml blasticidin and expanded for 10&#x02013;14 d for subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Granule translocation and cytoskeletal rearrangement.</title><p>Examination of granule translocation by confocal microscopy was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). In brief, BMMCs were transduced with pMX-CD63GFP retroviruses at day 5 after bone marrow culture in IL-3 medium. At 3 wk after the initial culture, BMMCs were sensitized with anti-DNP IgE and stimulated with DNP-HSA for 10 min. Cells were immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde before cytospin and visualized by confocal microscopy. For cytoskeletal rearrangement, cells were permeabilized in a buffer containing 0.1% saponin (2% FBS, 1% BSA, and 0.02% sodium azide in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature. After cytospin, cells were stained with anti&#x02013;&#x003b1;-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:50 dilution and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti&#x02013;mouse IgG and rhodamine phalloidin (Invitrogen).
