Recruitment and activation of PKD at the TGN is mediated by the lipid diacylglycerol, a pool of which is generated by sphingomyelin synthase from ceramide and phosphatidylcholine. The nonvesicular transfer of ceramide from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex is mediated by the lipid transfer protein CERT (ceramide transport). In this study, we identify CERT as a novel in vivo PKD substrate. Phosphorylation on serine 132 by PKD decreases the affinity of CERT toward its lipid target phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate at Golgi membranes and reduces ceramide transfer activity, identifying PKD as a regulator of lipid homeostasis. We also show that CERT, in turn, is critical for PKD activation and PKD-dependent protein cargo transport to the plasma membrane. Thus, the interdependence of PKD and CERT is key to the maintenance of Golgi membrane integrity and secretory transport.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>T. Fugmann and A.

PKD contains two zinc finger&#x02013;like cysteine-rich motifs that bind DAG, a pleckstrin homology (PH), and a kinase domain. PKD localizes to the cytosol, nucleus, Golgi complex, and plasma membrane, where it regulates diverse cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rykx et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wang, 2006</xref>). Thus far, only a few physiological PKD substrates are known (e.g., the neuronal protein Kidins220, the Ras effector RIN1, HDAC5, and PI4KIII&#x003b2;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Iglesias et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Vega et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hausser et al., 2005</xref>). At the TGN, PKD is critically involved in the fission of transport carriers en route to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liljedahl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yeaman et al., 2004</xref>). PKD is recruited to the TGN by its cysteine-rich regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Maeda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baron and Malhotra, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hausser et al., 2002</xref>), where it is activated by PKC&#x003b7;-mediated phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Diaz Anel and Malhotra, 2005</xref>). PKD-mediated phosphorylation of PI4KIII&#x003b2; stimulates its lipid kinase activity, resulting in enhanced phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) production and cargo transport to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hausser et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that PKD also phosphorylates and regulates the activity of the Golgi-localized ceramide transfer protein (CERT; also known as Goodpasture antigen-binding protein), a cytosolic protein essential for the nonvesicular delivery of ceramide from its site of production at the ER to Golgi membranes, where conversion to sphingomyelin (SM) takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hanada et al., 2003</xref>). Two CERT isoforms exist: the more abundantly expressed, alternatively spliced form missing a 26&#x02013;amino acid serine-rich region and the full-length 624&#x02013;amino acid protein, which is designated CERT<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Raya et al., 2000</xref>). Both CERT isoforms possess a steroidogenic acute regulatory lipid transfer (START) domain that is necessary and sufficient for ceramide binding and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hanada et al., 2003</xref>). START domains are &#x0223c;210 amino acids in length and form a hydrophobic tunnel that accommodates a monomeric lipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Soccio and Breslow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alpy and Tomasetto, 2005</xref>). They are found in 15 mammalian proteins, with CERT being most closely related to Pctp, which binds and shuttles phosphatidylcholine (PC) between membranes, and StarD10, a lipid transfer protein specific for PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Soccio and Breslow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Olayioye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wirtz, 2006</xref>). CERT proteins further contain an N-terminal PH domain with specificity for PI(4)P that contributes to Golgi localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Levine and Munro, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hanada et al., 2003</xref>) and an FFAT motif (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract) that targets the protein to the ER via interaction with the ER resident transmembrane proteins VAP-A and VAP-B (vesicle-associated membrane protein&#x02013;associated protein; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Loewen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kawano et al., 2006</xref>). Nonvesicular lipid transfer is thought to occur at membrane contact sites, at which the ER comes into close apposition with other organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Levine and Loewen, 2006</xref>). CERT may thus shuttle a very short distance between ER and Golgi membranes or perhaps contact both compartments simultaneously. When overexpressed, the START domain of CERT is sufficient for ceramide transfer to the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kawano et al., 2006</xref>). However, under physiological conditions, both Golgi and ER targeting motifs are essential for CERT function. In the CHO cell line LY-A, CERT was identified to contain a mutation within its PH domain (G67E), rendering the protein defective in PI(4)P binding, which resulted in reduced cellular SM levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hanada et al., 2003</xref>). The PI(4)P requirement for CERT function is further supported by a recent study showing that PI4KIII&#x003b2; activity is necessary for efficient ceramide trafficking to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Toth et al., 2006</xref>). We now provide evidence that PKD phosphorylates CERT on serine 132 adjacent to the PH domain, whereby PI(4)P binding, Golgi targeting, and ceramide transfer activity are negatively regulated. Furthermore, by transferring ceramide that is required for DAG production to Golgi membranes, CERT stimulates PKD activity and ensures the maintenance of constitutive secretory transport.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>PKD is a key regulator at the Golgi complex, with PI4KIII&#x003b2; being the only local substrate identified thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hausser et al., 2005</xref>). To test whether the Golgi complex&#x02013;localized CERT protein may serve as a substrate for PKD, we made use of a phosphospecific substrate antibody, termed pMOTIF, that was raised against consensus motifs phosphorylated by PKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Doppler et al., 2005</xref>). HEK293T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding Flag-tagged CERT and CERT<sub>L</sub>. Immunoprecipitated CERT isoforms were analyzed by Western blotting with the pMOTIF antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). A pMOTIF signal corresponding to the molecular weight of CERT and, more weakly, to that of CERT<sub>L</sub> was detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The weaker detection of the CERT<sub>L</sub> isoform by &#x0223c;25% compared with CERT may be related to its known behavior to form aggregates, which may impact phosphosite accessibility to kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Raya et al., 2000</xref>). To investigate whether recognition of CERT by the pMOTIF antibody was dependent on PKD, we expressed CERT together with a kinase-dead (KD) dominant-negative PKD1 variant (PKD1-KD) in HEK293T cells. Coexpression of inactive PKD1 abolished CERT detection by the pMOTIF antibody, suggesting that the signal was indeed the result of PKD-mediated CERT phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). To address the question of which PKD isoform was responsible for CERT phosphorylation, we used an RNAi approach to down-regulate PKD. Silencing of only one isoform did not influence the level of CERT phosphorylation as judged by immunoblotting with the pMOTIF antibody (unpublished data). However, simultaneous knockdown of PKD1 and PKD2 greatly reduced CERT phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), suggesting that these two isoforms were primarily responsible for phosphorylating CERT, whereas PKD3 appeared to play a minor role. This is in accordance with previously reported overlapping substrate specificities of PKD1 and PKD2, which both phosphorylate PI4KIII&#x003b2;, whereas PKD3 fails to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hausser et al., 2005</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>CERT is detected by a PKD substrate antibody.</bold> (A) HEK293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding Flag-tagged CERT<sub>L</sub> and CERT.

It was recently reported that OSBP (oxysterol-binding protein) promotes CERT translocation to the Golgi complex in response to stimulation with its ligand, 25-hydroxycholesterol, thereby integrating sterol signaling and SM synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Perry and Ridgway, 2006</xref>). In line with these studies, 25-hydroxycholesterol treatment was found to augment CERT phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), possibly by bringing CERT to the Golgi in the vicinity of PKD. CERT has been demonstrated to colocalize with the cis/medial-Golgi marker GS28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hanada et al., 2003</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis of GFP-tagged CERT expressed in COS7 cells showed that the protein localized to GS28-positive Golgi regions (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200612017/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200612017/DC1</ext-link>). However, lipid transfer proteins are thought to act at membrane contact sites, which are formed between the ER and TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Levine and Loewen, 2006</xref>), where PKD is localized. Immunofluorescence staining of Flag-tagged CERT coexpressed with GFP-tagged PKD in COS7 cells revealed that the two proteins colocalize at the Golgi complex. Furthermore, staining of the TGN-specific marker protein TGN46 verified that CERT partially localizes to this compartment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>).</p><p>To identify pMOTIF recognition sites in CERT, we searched for potential PKD consensus motifs characterized by a leucine, isoleucine, or valine residue in the &#x02212;5 position and arginine in the &#x02212;3 position relative to a serine or threonine. Two serines at positions 132 and 272 matching the PKD consensus motif (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>) were exchanged for alanines by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutants were expressed in HEK293T cells and tested for recognition by the pMOTIF antibody. Interestingly, mutation of serine 132 to alanine abrogated the detection of CERT with the pMOTIF antibody and caused an increase in electrophoretic mobility, which is indicative of the loss of phosphorylation, whereas the S272A mutation did not affect the pMOTIF signal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). On low percentage gels, the wild-type (WT) protein migrated as two distinct bands, indicating the presence of a phosphorylated and a nonphosphorylated CERT pool (unpublished data). To confirm that PKD was capable of directly phosphorylating serine 132, we performed in vitro kinase assays with purified PKD1 and recombinant CERT GST fusion proteins comprising the first 138 amino acids of the protein. WT CERT was efficiently phosphorylated by PKD1, whereas the CERT-S132A protein showed a strongly reduced incorporation of radioactivity in this assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Furthermore, in vitro PKD phosphorylation of WT but not CERT-S132A generated a recognition site for the pMOTIF antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Collectively, these results prove that CERT is a genuine PKD substrate in vitro and in vivo and identify serine 132 as a specific PKD phosphorylation site in CERT that can be monitored with the pMOTIF antibody.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>PKD phosphorylates CERT on serine 132.</bold> (A) Alignment of the peptide sequences used to raise the pMOTIF antibody and two potential PKD motifs in CERT.

Therefore, we quantified PI(4)P binding of CERT-WT and -S132A by performing protein&#x02013;lipid overlay assays. Cytosol from cells transiently expressing the CERT variants was incubated with membranes spotted with a concentration gradient of the different phosphoinositides, and bound CERT proteins were detected via their GFP tag. As reported previously, the WT protein demonstrated weak binding to several phospholipid species but displayed strong interaction with PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Levine and Munro, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hanada et al., 2003</xref>). CERT-S132A binding to PI(4)P was detectable at two- to fourfold lower concentrations as compared with that of the WT protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). To corroborate these results, the association of CERT with multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) consisting of PC alone or PC plus 5% PI(4)P was measured. Although the addition of PI(4)P to PC vesicles increased the membrane binding of CERT-WT 1.5-fold, the binding of CERT-S132A was enhanced 1.9-fold, suggesting an increased affinity of the CERT-S132A mutant to PI(4)P (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). To investigate whether this affected the association with Golgi membranes in intact cells, we performed fractionation studies with cells expressing CERT-WT and -S132A. To estimate the level of ER binding, we included a CERT mutant (G67E) defective in PI(4)P binding. Only a small proportion of the WT and G67E protein were recovered in the pellet fraction, suggesting that under the experimental conditions used, ER binding was negligible, and Golgi association of the WT protein was not maintained (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). The CERT-S132A mutant protein was highly enriched in the pellet fraction, confirming that the enhanced affinity for PI(4)P stabilizes membrane association in vivo. Together, these data imply that CERT, once bound to the Golgi complex, is phosphorylated by PKD. This then decreases the affinity of CERT to PI(4)P and, thereby, regulates the interaction of CERT with the Golgi complex. Because PI(4)P is also present at the plasma membrane, additional factors must specify CERT targeting to the Golgi complex. One candidate is Arf1, which has been shown to interact with the structurally related proteins OSBP and FAPP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Levine and Munro, 2002</xref>). Whether CERT phosphorylation influences binding to such additional factors remains to be tested in the future.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>CERT phosphorylation on serine 132 modulates PI(4)P binding and ceramide transfer activity.</bold> HEK293T cells transiently expressing the indicated GFP-tagged CERT variants were harvested by hypotonic lysis, and the cytosol fraction was recovered after 100,000 <italic>g</italic> centrifugation.

Thus, we investigated whether CERT phosphorylation on serine 132 influenced its ability to bind and transfer ceramide between membranes. To this end, GFP-tagged versions of CERT-WT and -S132A were transiently expressed in HEK239T cells, and the cytosol fraction was analyzed for ceramide-specific lipid transfer activity using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer&#x02013;based assay. In this assay, vesicles containing pyrene-labeled ceramide as a fluorescent donor and quenching amounts of 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (TNP-PE) were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Somerharju, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Olayioye et al., 2005</xref>). The lipid preparation used was total extract from porcine brain, which is likely to contain PI(4)P. Upon the addition of cytosol-containing CERT-WT, a steady increase in fluorescence was noted, which was not observed when control cytosol of vector-transfected cells was used (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Compared with the WT protein, CERT-S132A displayed a higher rate of lipid transfer, which was evident from a more rapid increase in pyrene fluorescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Similar results were obtained when 0.5% PI(4)P was added to donor liposomes (unpublished data). This suggests that CERT phosphorylation on serine 132 down-regulates ceramide transfer activity, most likely by decreasing association of the protein with membranes. Previous data have already shown that PKD regulates the level of PI(4)P at the Golgi complex by the phosphorylation-mediated activation of PI4KIII&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hausser et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, PI4KIII&#x003b2; is critical for the transport of ceramide between the ER and the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Toth et al., 2006</xref>). Accordingly, together with the data presented in this study, a dual role for PKD in maintaining lipid homeostasis of Golgi membranes becomes apparent by controlling the on rate (via PI(4)P levels) and off rate (via direct phosphorylation) of CERT.</p><p>The transfer of ceramide from the ER to the TGN is essential for SM synthesis at this compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hanada et al., 2003</xref>). Golgi-localized SM synthase 1 utilizes ceramide and PC to generate SM and DAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Perry and Ridgway, 2005</xref>), the latter being a prerequisite for PKD recruitment and activation. Compounds that block DAG production at the TGN inhibit the binding of PKD to TGN membranes and interfere with secretory transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baron and Malhotra, 2002</xref>). Therefore, increased ceramide transfer from the ER to the TGN by the overexpression of CERT should result in an elevated local DAG pool and may consequently stimulate PKD activity and secretory transport. To test this hypothesis, we transiently expressed CERT-WT and -S132A in HEK293T cells and analyzed the autophosphorylation of endogenous PKD. Compared with the control, the expression of both CERT-WT and -S132A increased PKD activity, as revealed by analyses with a phosphospecific PKD antibody (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). CERT has been reported to possess kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Raya et al., 2000</xref>), making it possible that it activates PKD by direct phosphorylation. However, kinase assays clearly demonstrated that PKD is not phosphorylated by CERT. Moreover, a kinase activity was associated with the CERT protein only under mild detergent conditions (Fig. S1). Thus, our results show that PKD activation is regulated by CERT proteins, most likely as a result of increased ceramide delivery and enforced SM/DAG synthesis. A similar function has recently been described for the lipid transfer protein Nir2 in the maintenance of DAG levels at the Golgi apparatus via regulation of the cytidine-5&#x02032;-diphosphate&#x02013;choline pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Litvak et al., 2005</xref>). RNAi-mediated knockdown of Nir2 decreased DAG and PKD levels at the Golgi complex and blocked secretory transport. Interestingly, this effect could be rescued by the addition of exogenous C<sub>6</sub>-ceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Litvak et al., 2005</xref>), indicating a critical role for ceramide in DAG synthesis and PKD recruitment to the Golgi complex.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>CERT regulates PKD activation and secretory transport.</bold> (A) HEK293T cells transiently expressing CERT-WT and -S132A were lysed, and PKD activation was analyzed by immunoblotting with pS910 PKD antibody (top).

CERT is marked with an arrow.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1780015f04"></graphic></fig><p>To address the question of whether CERT-mediated PKD activation indeed translated into enhanced secretory transport, we made use of a plasmid encoding HRP fused to a signal sequence (ss). The fusion protein ssHRP can be used as a reporter for constitutive protein secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bard et al., 2006</xref>). In control cells, secretion of ssHRP could be detected within 1 h and increased over time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Coexpression of PKD1-KD, which inhibits the secretory transport of cargo protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liljedahl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hausser et al., 2005</xref>), almost entirely abrogated ssHRP secretion. This confirmed that HRP was secreted in a PKD-dependent manner in our assay. Coexpression of CERT-WT and -S132A strongly augmented the amount of secreted HRP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Conversely, knockdown of CERT by RNAi in COS7 cells inhibited the secretion of HRP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and D</xref>), confirming the essential role for CERT in the constitutive exocytosis of cargo proteins. We could only detect a slight increase in secretion with the S132A mutant compared with the one observed with the WT protein. This is in accordance with the comparable activation of PKD by CERT-WT and -S132A (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>) but was unexpected in light of the substantially enhanced in vitro lipid transfer activity of the CERT mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). However, increased levels of ceramide may not necessarily translate into equivalent increases in DAG because DAG synthesis might be limited by the availability of PC and the activity of SM synthase.</p><p>The accumulation of ceramide is known to affect Golgi membrane stability and induces vesicle fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Weigert et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fukunaga et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether overexpression of the CERT-S132A mutant affected its localization and/or caused morphological changes of the Golgi apparatus. In addition to concentrating in GS28-positive regions of the Golgi complex, the CERT-S132A mutant displayed a dispersed punctate staining (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). However, the distribution of GS28 itself and that of TGN46 was not affected by the expression of CERT-S132A, nor were these proteins present in the vesicular structures observed with the mutant CERT protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). This rules out fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus as a consequence of CERT-S132A overexpression. Some of the vesicular structures were found to contain the cargo protein ssHRP, providing evidence that these structures represent Golgi-derived transport carriers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). It thus appears that the increased membrane affinity of CERT-S132A prevents its dissociation from budding vesicles. Interestingly, when coexpressed with CERT-S132A, the PH domain of OSBP also localized to these vesicles, indicating that these structures are PI(4)P positive (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). The CERT-S132A mutant may therefore inhibit PI(4)P turnover, thus stabilizing the lipid on transport carriers. Of note, a CERT-S132E protein was indistinguishable from the alanine mutant in terms of cellular localization and, thus, could not be used to mimic the phosphorylated state (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>CERT-S132A localizes to PI(4)P-positive secretory vesicles.</bold> (A and B) COS7 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression plasmids.

PKD then activates PI4KIII&#x003b2;, increasing PI(4)P levels at the TGN. This, in turn, recruits the CERT protein to the Golgi complex, where it contributes to PKD activation and vesicular transport processes by providing ceramide as a precursor for further DAG production. The system is tightly regulated by a negative feedback loop: active PKD phosphorylates CERT at serine 132, thus decreasing the affinity of CERT toward its lipid target PI(4)P to ensure continuous rounds of lipid transfer from the ER to the Golgi compartment. In conclusion, we have identified CERT as a PKD substrate and provide evidence for a novel relationship between membrane lipid biogenesis and protein secretion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>Cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min, washed, and incubated with PBS containing 0.1 M glycine for 15 min.
