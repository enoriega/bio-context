The relationship of Vav localization to its function is presently unclear. We found that Vav redistributes to the plasma membrane in response to Fc&#x02208; receptor I (Fc&#x02208;RI) engagement. The redistribution of Vav was mediated by its Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and required Syk activity. The Fc&#x02208;RI and Vav were found to colocalize and were recruited to glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs). The scaffold protein, linker for activation of T cells (LAT), and Rac1 (a target of Vav activity) were constitutively present in GEMs. Expression of an SH2 domain&#x02013;containing COOH-terminal fragment of Vav inhibited Vav phosphorylation and movement to the GEMs but had no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein, SLP-76 (SH2 domain&#x02013;containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD), and LAT. However, assembly of the multiprotein complex containing these proteins was inhibited. In addition, Fc&#x02208;RI-dependent activation of c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) was also inhibited.

Recent studies have begun to elucidate some of the workings, suggesting that receptor-induced formation of macromolecular signaling complexes, mediated by molecular scaffolds and adaptors  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R1">1</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R2">2</xref>, can link receptors to multiple signaling pathways. However, where and how receptors engage these macromolecular complexes are still unresolved questions. The recognition that plasma membrane proteins and lipids can differentially partition, forming discrete microdomains that are enriched in particular types of proteins and lipids, has prompted investigative efforts to determine if such domains are critical components of receptor-mediated cellular signaling  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R3">3</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R4">4</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R5">5</xref>. Glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs) constitute one such membrane domain that concentrates sphingolipids, cholesterol, glycophosphatidylinositol-linked proteins, and numerous signaling molecules  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R4">4</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R5">5</xref>. The concentration of diverse signaling molecules in these domains suggests their importance in multiple signaling pathways.</p><p>Recently, Ag receptors (including Fc&#x02208;RI) and costimulatory molecules have been shown to be constitutively present or to partition to these domains upon their engagement  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R7">7</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R8">8</xref>. Furthermore, recent work suggests that Vav can be found complexed with linker for activation of T cells (LAT), a scaffolding protein that partially partitions to GEMs  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref>. Thus, GEMs are reasonable candidates as sites for receptor&#x02013;downstream effector coupling. In a prior study, we found that Fc&#x02208;RI could be coimmunoprecipitated with the hematopoietic cell&#x02013;specific protein, Vav, after receptor aggregation  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R10">10</xref>. Because Fc&#x02208;RI engagement results in the movement of a considerable fraction of these receptors into GEMs  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref>, perhaps GEMs might be sites of interaction between Fc&#x02208;RI and Vav and thus Vav localization to GEMs a required step for its function.</p><p>Tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav is important for its GDP/GTP exchange activity that activates Rho family GTPases like Rac1, which function(s) in the regulation of cellular architechture  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R12">12</xref>. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of Vav is encoded by the Dbl homology (DH) domain, whose function has also been demonstrated to contribute to c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) activation  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>. In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation can also contribute to the activation of Vav by binding to the Vav pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, thus increasing its activity  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref>. Among other structural domains of Vav are two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains and an SH2 domain  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R15">15</xref> that can interact with a diverse array of proteins  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R15">15</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R16">16</xref> and thus contribute to Vav function. For example, the Vav SH2 domain interacts with tyrosine kinases Syk and ZAP-70  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R17">17</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R18">18</xref> and adaptor molecules such as SH2 domain&#x02013;containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD (SLP-76 [19]) and Cbl  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R20">20</xref>. Another adaptor molecule, Grb2, binds to the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal SH3 domain of Vav  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R21">21</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R22">22</xref>. In addition, the Vav COOH-terminal SH3 domain binds the heterogeneous ribonuclear proteins (hnRNPs) K and C  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R23">23</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R24">24</xref>, the nuclear protein Ku-70  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R25">25</xref>, and the cytoskeletal protein zyxin  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R26">26</xref>. Given the diversity of proteins with which Vav can interact, enormous potential exists for the modulation of its localization in response to cellular stimuli.</p><p>To investigate the localization of Vav and its functional consequences, we tagged Vav with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and followed its distribution in the RBL-2H3 mast cell line before and after Fc&#x02208;RI engagement. Phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R27">27</xref>) of the Fc&#x02208;RI by Lyn, after Fc&#x02208;RI engagement, results in the recruitment and activation of Syk by its interaction with Fc&#x02208;RI&#x003b3; ITAM  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R28">28</xref>. Because Vav phosphorylation is downstream of Syk activation  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R29">29</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R30">30</xref>, we also investigated the importance of Syk to Vav localization. Furthermore, as a measure of whether the intracellular localization of Vav is important to its function, we assessed the activation of JNK1, as Fc&#x02208;RI-dependent JNK1 activation is mediated by Vav  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R31">31</xref>. Our findings show that phosphorylation and recruitment of Vav to the plasma membrane is an important step in Vav function in mast cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies, Reagents, and Cell Cultures.</title><p>Mouse mAbs to Vav, Rac1, LAT, phosphotyrosine (4G10), Grb2, SLP-76, and GFP were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Transduction Laboratories, and Clontech.

As shown in  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> A, GFP was evenly distributed throughout the cell and was included in the nucleus. No apparent association of GFP with the plasma membrane was evident ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> A). In contrast, the addition of Vav to GFP caused a dramatic change in the distribution of GFP, with little inclusion of Vav-GFP in the nucleus. This suggested that Vav is primarily localized to the cytosol and sequesters the fused GFP in the cytosol. To verify that the addition of GFP to Vav did not affect its localization, we determined the distribution of endogenous Vav by immunofluorescence and found it to be essentially identical ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> A). A consistently higher background was found for the immunofluorescence staining with antibody to Vav, and thus we focused on Vav-GFP redistribution.</p><p>Fc&#x02208;RI engagement resulted in the redistribution of a significant fraction of Vav to the plasma membrane as a submembranous aggregate at the indicated Ag concentrations ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> B). In contrast, no change in the distribution of GFP was observed in response to Fc&#x02208;RI engagement, although the cells treated with 300 ng Ag showed increased spreading or flattening ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> B). Two distinct features of Vav overexpression and its relationship to Fc&#x02208;RI engagement were observed. First, Vav overexpression resulted in the spreading or flattening of the cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> B), and this was further enhanced by Fc&#x02208;RI engagement. Second, the redistribution of Vav was not uniform and seemed to be most prominent at cell&#x02013;cell contacts where one might expect larger aggregates of Fc&#x02208;RI to form, provided that receptors on contacting cells bound the same Ag ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> B). In kinetic experiments, Vav moved to the plasma membrane within 1 min and persisted in the plasma membrane even at 27 min after receptor engagement.</p></sec><sec><title>Vav Colocalization with Fc&#x02208;RI Is Dependent on an Intact SH2 Domain.</title><p>We previously reported the specific coimmunoprecipitation of Fc&#x02208;RI with Vav in response to Fc&#x02208;RI engagement  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R10">10</xref>. We revisited this issue to explore whether the observed aggregates of Vav represent the fraction of Vav that might colocalize with Fc&#x02208;RI. Fc&#x02208;RI was evenly distributed in unstimulated control (GFP) and Vav (Vav-GFP) transfected cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A, Anti-&#x003b2;). After Fc&#x02208;RI engagement, microaggregates of Fc&#x02208;RI were formed at the plasma membrane. This is in agreement with earlier reports of Fc&#x02208;RI clustering after stimulation, as visualized with FITC- or PE-labeled IgE  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R37">37</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R38">38</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R39">39</xref>. In adherent cells, these Fc&#x02208;RI microaggregates appeared to focalize to the cell&#x02013;cell contact points after Fc&#x02208;RI engagement ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A). Vav and Fc&#x02208;RI aggregates showed an identical distribution, with a significant fraction of Fc&#x02208;RI codistributing with Vav in the stimulated adherent ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A) and in nonadherent cells (data not shown). Colocalization of a considerable fraction of Fc&#x02208;RI aggregates (&#x0003e;30%) with plasma membrane&#x02013;localized Vav aggregates was observed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A, Overlay).</p><p>We previously found that Vav did not directly interact with the Fc&#x02208;RI&#x003b3; ITAMs. Nevertheless, as Vav is known to be phosphorylated by and to interact with Syk  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R17">17</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R29">29</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R30">30</xref>, we investigated which structural domain(s) of Vav might be important for its colocalization with Fc&#x02208;RI.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> B shows that deletion of the CH, DH, and PH domains had little effect on Vav redistribution and colocalization with Fc&#x02208;RI. Only the SH2 domain was found to be important for redistribution of Vav to the plasma membrane and for its colocalization with Fc&#x02208;RI. Deletion of the SH2 domain (data not shown) or mutation of R694K in the SH2 domain of Vav completely ablated the plasma membrane redistribution of Vav and thus the colocalization with Fc&#x02208;RI ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> B). As shown in  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> C, a fluorescence intensity profile of Fc&#x02208;RI-stimulated cells expressing Vav-GFP showed almost complete fluorescence overlap with Fc&#x02208;RI compared with cells expressing the R694K mutation of Vav. In addition, the deletion or mutation of the Vav SH2 domain also resulted in the loss of Vav tyrosine phosphorylation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> D) while no significant effect on the phosphorylation of the CH, DH, or PH domain&#x02013;deleted constructs was observed (data not shown). Thus, one might conclude that plasma membrane localization is required for Vav phosphorylation. Alternatively, the Vav SH2 domain&#x02013;mediated interaction with Syk or ZAP-70  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R17">17</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R40">40</xref> may be required for Vav phosphorylation, or both possibilities may contribute to Vav phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec><title>The SH2 Domain of Vav Contributes to JNK1 Activation.</title><p>Kinetic analysis of JNK1 activation in RBL cells revealed that maximal enzymatic activity was at 8 min after Fc&#x02208;RI engagement (our unpublished results). Fc&#x02208;RI engagement (8 min) of cells overexpressing wild-type Vav enhanced the activation of JNK1 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> E). We investigated the importance of the SH2 domain for Vav function by studying whether the Vav mutant (R694K) was capable of enhancing JNK1 activation. Mutant Vav (R694K) did not enhance the JNK1 activation, unlike the wild-type Vav ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> E). In addition, more prolonged (16 min) Ag stimulation of cells expressing Vav (R694K) did not provide any enhancement of JNK1 activity (data not shown). The JNK1 response for the mutant Vav (R694K) was similar to that observed for the control GFP transfectant, suggesting that this mutation did not exhibit a dominant negative phenotype. Additionally, as we reported elsewhere  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>, the deletion of the Vav DH domain also resulted in reduced JNK1 activation and mimicked the expression of an inactive Rac1 (N17). Deletion of the CH or PH domains showed no or little effect, respectively, on JNK1 activation. Thus, because ablation of the GEF activity (DH&#x02212;) of a plasma membrane localized Vav ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> B) or inhibition of redistribution of wild-type Vav to the plasma membrane resulted in a loss of enhanced JNK activity, we conclude that the movement of Vav to the plasma membrane is important to its role in JNK1 activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Syk Activity Is Required for Vav Redistribution.</title><p>Inhibition of Syk activity or a deficiency of Syk in mast cells results in the loss of Vav phosphorylation  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R30">30</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R41">41</xref>. To assess if Vav redistribution was dependent on Syk activity or on the presence of Syk, we used several approaches. Vav was overexpressed in the TB1A2 cells, a Syk<sup>&#x02212;</sup> RBL-2H3 cell line  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R30">30</xref>. In the absence or presence of Fc&#x02208;RI engagement, Vav failed to redistribute to the plasma membrane and form aggregates ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A). Furthermore, analogous to the mutation of the Vav SH2 domain, the endogenous and overexpressed Vav was not phosphorylated in these cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> B, and data not shown). Cotransfection of Syk and Vav in the TB1A2 cells led to the reconstitution of plasma membrane&#x02013;localized Vav, its tyrosine phosphorylation, and its colocalization with Fc&#x02208;RI after the latter's engagement ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. b</xref>). As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table </xref>, Vav aggregates were also observed after Fc&#x02208;RI engagement in a TB1A2-derived clone stably reconstituted with Syk (clone 3A1). In contrast, the TB1A2-derived clone reconstituted with a catalytically inactive Syk (clone 3BA12) or RBL cells pretreated with piceatannol, a Syk-selective inhibitor, failed to show Vav redistribution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table </xref>), clearly demonstrating the requirement for Syk activity in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav and its redistribution to the plasma membrane.</p><p>We also found that Syk and Vav synergized in the activation of JNK1 in Syk-deficient cells. Expression of Vav alone in these cells, followed by Fc&#x02208;RI engagement, caused a 2.2-fold enhancement in JNK1 activation compared with the control nonstimulated GFP transfectant ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> C). Expression of Syk alone also caused a 2.3-fold enhancement in JNK1 activity. However, a 3.6-fold increase in JNK1 activation was seen when Vav was coexpressed with Syk. As shown below, the activation of JNK1 required the plasma membrane localization of Vav.</p><p>We investigated whether Syk mediates the interaction of Vav with the plasma membrane. The following evidence suggested that Vav aggregate formation is not directly mediated by Vav interaction with Syk. First, we did not detect colocalization of Vav with Syk under conditions, described previously  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R39">39</xref>, where Syk is maximally localized to the plasma membrane (data not shown). Second, other adaptor proteins that could facilitate Vav interaction with the plasma membrane were localized with Vav aggregates (see  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref> and  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. e</xref>, and  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). Third, preliminary experiments in Fc&#x02208;RI- and Lyn-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R42">42</xref> showed no redistribution of transfected Vav to the plasma membrane under conditions where Syk was membrane localized and both Syk and Vav were tyrosine phosphorylated (data not shown). Although we cannot formally exclude a plasma membrane&#x02013;localized interaction of Syk and Vav, the preponderance of evidence suggests a different mechanism for Vav plasma membrane association.</p></sec><sec><title>Vav, LAT, Rac1, and Fc&#x02208;RI Are Found in GEMs.</title><p>Biochemical studies demonstrated the constitutive association of Vav with Grb2  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R10">10</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R21">21</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R22">22</xref> and the receptor-dependent association of Vav with SLP-76  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R43">43</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R44">44</xref> and LAT  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R45">45</xref>. LAT is a palmitoylated protein that partitions to GEMs and can form a complex with SLP-76 and Vav  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R46">46</xref>. To establish a link of communication, it was possible that Vav and Fc&#x02208;RI might be found in GEMs after Fc&#x02208;RI engagement. Because the SH2 domain of Vav is critical for plasma membrane localization, we reasoned that the SH3-SH2-SH3 domains of Vav (Vav-C), which were previously described to inhibit Vav activity  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref>, might compete with endogenous Vav for plasma membrane localization. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether Vav-C would localize to the plasma membrane by expressing both Vav-C and Vav-C (R694K) tagged with GFP and subsequently engaging the Fc&#x02208;RI. Vav-C was redistributed to the plasma membrane, whereas the Vav-C (R694K) mutant failed to membrane localize ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A). The expression of GFP, Vav-C, or Vav-C (R694K) was found to be similar ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B). In addition, Vav-C was tyrosine phosphorylated as described  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref>, whereas Vav-C (R694K) was only weakly phosphorylated (data not shown). This suggested that Vav-C might act as a competitive inhibitor of Vav phosphorylation, and led us to explore its effect on the phosphorylation of wild-type Vav.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> C shows that Vav-C inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation and association of Vav with Syk, whereas Vav-C (R694K) did not. In addition, although in the experiment shown there is a minor effect on Syk phosphorylation, multiple experiments suggested that Vav-C expression had no effect on Syk phosphorylation before or after Fc&#x02208;RI engagement. Therefore, Vav-C competes with Vav as a substrate for Syk and can localize to the plasma membrane as a competitor for endogenous Vav.</p><p>We established that immunoprecipitation of endogenous Vav or LAT resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous LAT, Grb2, SLP-76, or Vav ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> D). We used the expression of Vav-C to analyze whether the competitor had any effect on formation of a multiprotein complex of Vav with the SLP-76 and LAT. SLP-76 was immunoprecipitated from Fc&#x02208;RI-stimulated or -nonstimulated cells that were transiently transfected with Vav tagged with GFP (to enhance the formation of a complex with SLP-76) in the presence of the Vav-C inhibitor also tagged with GFP, or of GFP alone. SLP-76 immunoprecipitates from the stimulated cells that were expressing Vav-C showed marked inhibition of Vav coimmunoprecipitation with SLP-76 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> E). Moreover, an inhibition of LAT association with SLP-76 was also observed, although this was not as dramatic as the inhibition of Vav and SLP-76 interaction ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> E). The association of Grb2 with SLP-76 was not inhibited ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> E). As determined by immunoprecipitating each individual protein, no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk, SLP-76, or LAT ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>,  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. e</xref>, and  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. f</xref>) was observed by expression of Vav-C or the controls, Vav-C (R694K) and GFP. Therefore, Vav-C specifically inhibits Vav phosphorylation and its association with SLP-76 and LAT.</p><p>In RBL-2H3 cells, a significant fraction (as much as 50%) of the Fc&#x02208;RI can be found in GEMs after extensive aggregation of this receptor  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref>. Given that LAT is also found in these domains  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref>, we now asked whether Vav might also be recruited to these membrane domains in response to Fc&#x02208;RI engagement. Furthermore, if the LAT/SLP-76/Vav complex formation takes place in the GEMs, we should effectively compete the recruitment of Vav in the GEMs by overexpression of Vav-C.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A shows that Vav and Fc&#x02208;RI are recruited in the LAT-containing GEMs (fractions 4&#x02013;6) after Fc&#x02208;RI engagement. Fc&#x02208;RI recruitment to GEMs was primarily monitored by the irreversible binding of radiolabeled IgE ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R47">47</xref>&#x0003b; see graph,  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A) and ranged from 15 to 50% with a mean of 20%. However, we could also detect the presence of phosphorylated Fc&#x02208;RI &#x003b2; chain and the GEM-localized Lyn  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref>, but not paxillin (a GEM-excluded protein  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R48">48</xref>), when tested by immunoblotting (data not shown, and  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). The presence of Vav in the GEMs was effectively reduced by the overexpression of Vav-C but not by the overexpression of the control Vav-C (R694K). In five experiments, inhibition of Vav localization to GEMs by Vav-C ranged from 35 to 100%. Both exogenously and endogenously expressed Vav were tyrosine phosphorylated and localized to the GEMs, and the localization was inhibited by Vav-C expression ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). No inhibition was observed by expression of Vav-C (R694K) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). In addition, we also found that Rac1, the target of Vav GEF activity, was constitutively present in GEMs and its presence in GEMs was slightly increased by Fc&#x02208;RI engagement ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). This is consistent with a recent study  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R49">49</xref> demonstrating that Rac1 is constitutively present in caveolae and is further recruited to these membrane domains in response to platelet-derived growth factor. Thus, engagement of Fc&#x02208;RI actively recruits phosphorylated Vav and Fc&#x02208;RI into LAT- and Rac1-containing GEMs, suggesting that the presence of Vav in these domains may be functionally important.</p></sec><sec><title>Vav Activity Is Required for JNK1 Activation.</title><p>To address the functional importance of Vav, we tested whether the expression of Vav-C would have an effect on endogenous Vav activity and explored the possible correlation with the formation of a Vav-containing GEM-residing complex. Because a Vav-dependent activation of JNK1, which mimics Rac1 activation of JNK1, had been demonstrated  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R31">31</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R50">50</xref>, we assayed for the activation of JNK1 in cells expressing Vav-C. We chose to look at JNK1 activity, rather than its phosphorylation, to obtain a more direct quantitative measure of any effect. As shown in  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> B, expression of Vav-C inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Vav and decreased the Fc&#x02208;RI-induced JNK1 activation by 81 &#x000b1; 17%. Some reduction of the basal levels of JNK1 activity in these cells was also observed. No effect was observed by expression of either GFP or Vav-C (R694K) as controls. Thus, the expression of Vav-C, which inhibits Vav phosphorylation and movement to GEMs, also results in inhibition of Fc&#x02208;RI-mediated JNK1 activation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> B) in the absence of an effect on Syk activity or on the phosphorylation of SLP-76 and LAT ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>,  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. e</xref>, and  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. f</xref>). We previously demonstrated  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref> that the constitutively active Rac1 (V12) and the inactive Rac1 (N17) (which function at the plasma membrane [12, 49]) mimic or inhibit, respectively, Vav-induced JNK1 activation. Thus, collectively, our results suggest that phosphorylation of Vav and/or formation of a Vav-containing plasma membrane&#x02013;localized multiprotein complex may be required for the Vav-dependent activation of JNK1 after Fc&#x02208;RI engagement.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrates that Vav moves to the plasma membrane upon Fc&#x02208;RI engagement ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). In addition, we found that most of the membrane-localized Vav and a portion of the Fc&#x02208;RI partition to LAT- and Rac1-containing GEMs ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A), suggesting that these specialized membrane domains represent sites where receptors engage downstream effectors. Because Vav forms a complex with SLP-76 and LAT  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R44">44</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R45">45</xref>, our findings promote the view that Vav functions as part of a multiprotein signaling complex that is engaged by the Fc&#x02208;RI in the GEMs ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>The movement of Vav to the plasma membrane is dependent on Syk activity and the SH2 domain of Vav. Interestingly, we did not observe a loss in plasma membrane localization by deletion of the PH domain of Vav ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> B), a domain thought to be important for membrane targeting and Vav function  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R51">51</xref>. Thus, only the SH2 domain was found to mediate association with the plasma membrane components. The importance of this domain to the activation of Vav is underscored by the inability to phosphorylate the Vav (R694K) mutant in Syk-containing cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> D) and the inhibition of Vav phosphorylation by Vav-C, which also inhibits Vav binding to Syk in the absence of an effect on Syk phosphorylation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> C). Mutations of both Y342 and Y346 of rat Syk or the equivalent tyrosines on ZAP-70 have been demonstrated to inhibit Vav interaction  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R17">17</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R18">18</xref>. These mutations also inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav (Yamashita, T., personal communication). Thus, the use of the above Syk mutant would not allow us to distinguish whether Syk activity or Syk interaction is necessary for Vav redistribution. At present, our data suggest that the association of Vav with the plasma membrane is not mediated by Syk. This conclusion is best supported by our preliminary results in Fc&#x02208;RI-transfected CHO cells  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R42">42</xref> in which phosphorylation of receptor Syk and Vav did not result in Vav plasma membrane localization (under conditions where Syk was membrane localized). These results also suggest that Vav phosphorylation is not the sole requirement for plasma membrane localization. However, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that Syk might mediate some association of Vav with the plasma membrane.</p><p>Vav also interacts with adaptor proteins like SLP-76 that mediate binding to plasma membrane&#x02013;localized scaffolding proteins like LAT  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R46">46</xref> and thus could provide plasma membrane localization of Vav. Because a significant fraction of phosphorylated LAT is localized to GEMs ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref>&#x0003b; and  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A), communication between the Vav-containing molecular complex and Fc&#x02208;RI may likely occur in GEMs. Preliminary support for this hypothesis is provided by the similar kinetics of Fc&#x02208;RI and Vav localization to GEMs ( <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R52">52</xref>&#x0003b; and this study) and also by the observation that coexpression of Vav-C, which inhibits Fc&#x02208;RI-mediated JNK1 activation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> B), also effectively inhibited the presence of endogenous and exogenous Vav in GEMs ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). In addition, the previous finding  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref> that a DH domain&#x02013;deleted Vav is incapable of activating JNK1 although it localizes to the plasma membrane ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) underscores the importance of functional Vav in the plasma membrane. Thus, collectively, the findings promote the view that recruitment of Vav to GEMs may be an important step that couples the Fc&#x02208;RI  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref> to a macromolecular complex that regulates JNK1 activation  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R2">2</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R53">53</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R54">54</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R55">55</xref>.</p><p>Although not all of the cellular Vav moves to the plasma membrane, of the fraction localized in the plasma membrane almost all could be found to colocalize with the Fc&#x02208;RI (see  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. c</xref>). In contrast, &#x0223c;30% of receptors were found to colocalize with Vav. This may reflect the possibility that only activated receptors, or alternatively only receptors that become active, can associate with Vav. Our data are consistent with a possible site of communication for Fc&#x02208;RI and Vav being in GEMs, because the numbers obtained for colocalization correspond nicely with the fraction of Fc&#x02208;RI found in our study to be recruited to GEMs (&#x0223c;20%). In addition, these numbers are also consistent with the best estimates of the number of Fc&#x02208;RI molecules (25%) that have the potential to associate with the activating Lyn kinase in RBL-2H3 cells  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R56">56</xref>. Thus, our findings support the notion that the fraction of Fc&#x02208;RI found in GEMs is active  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref> and can link to downstream effectors like Vav. Notably, although phosphorylation of the Fc&#x02208;RI is not required for GEM localization  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref>, we found that receptors in the GEMs showed at least a 13-fold higher level of Fc&#x02208;RI &#x003b2; chain phosphorylation compared with the remaining receptors after normalization for protein content (data not shown). This is consistent with the studies of Field and colleagues  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref> and suggests that the GEMs may function both as a site of receptor phosphorylation  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref> and a site where receptors engage other signaling molecules  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R8">8</xref>.</p><p>Among the numerous proteins localized to GEMs, LAT has been clearly demonstrated to play an important functional role in TCR signaling  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R45">45</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R46">46</xref>. A recent study demonstrated that the costimulatory effects of CD28 on TCR-dependent activation are mediated by the CD28-dependent clustering of GEMs to the TCR  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R57">57</xref>. Thus, sustained T cell activation and/or sensitivity of TCR engagement is seemingly dependent on the coclustering of the TCR/CD28 in GEMs and is likely to be dependent on communication with LAT  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R45">45</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R46">46</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R57">57</xref>. In mast cells, a phosphoprotein of the approximate molecular mass of LAT was first described by Turner and colleagues as an Fc&#x02208;RI-activated link to Grb2-Sos  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R58">58</xref>. This protein was recently identified in RBL-2H3 mast cells as LAT  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R46">46</xref>. This scaffold protein is important in assembling a macromolecular signaling complex that includes at least phospholipase C&#x003b3;1, SLP-76, Vav, Grb2, and Cbl  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R45">45</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R46">46</xref>. We now demonstrate that in mast cells LAT, Rac1, and Vav are found in the GEMs. The Fc&#x02208;RI is also found in GEMs  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref>, and specific inhibition of Vav phosphorylation, which also inhibits its localization to GEMs, has a significant downregulatory effect on Fc&#x02208;RI-mediated JNK1 activation. Although we cannot formally exclude the possibility that another fraction (other than the plasma membrane&#x02013;localized fraction) of Vav is responsible for JNK1 activation, it is likely that a mechanism similar to that required for activation of Ras on the plasma membrane  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R59">59</xref> may also function to activate Rac. In the present model ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), activated Vav (a Rac1 GEF) is sequestered on the plasma membrane by the LAT&#x02013;SLP-76 complex where it activates Rac1.</p><p>Recent studies  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R55">55</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R60">60</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R61">61</xref> on T cells derived from Vav-null mice reported differences in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Costello and colleagues  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R61">61</xref> demonstrated that in T cells from these mice, extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase (ERK) activation was impaired. In contrast, the studies of Fischer et al.  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R60">60</xref> and Holsinger et al.  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R55">55</xref> found no effect on ERK or JNK activation. However, we  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref> and others  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R31">31</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R50">50</xref> have observed Vav-mediated JNK activation in various cell types. The apparent discrepancy may be explained by cell type differences (i.e., mast cells versus T cells), redundancy of signaling pathways, or as proposed by Costello et al.  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R61">61</xref>, differences in the knockout targeting strategy that could result in low levels of Vav expression. Nevertheless, because we demonstrate an effect on JNK1 activation by the deletion of the Vav SH2 domain and by expression of Vav-C, and found that Syk and Vav synergize to enhance JNK1 activation, we propose that Vav significantly contributes to Fc&#x02208;RI-mediated JNK1 activation. Moreover, this hypothesis is also supported by our recent findings that the inactive mutants Rac1 (N17) or JNK (APF) inhibit Vav-dependent JNK1 activation in the RBL-2H3 mast cell line  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>.</p><p>A recent study  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R43">43</xref> demonstrated that mutation of SLP-76 (Y112F, Y128F, Y145F) or mutation of the Vav SH2 domain abrogated both TCR-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangement and p21-activated kinase (PAK) activation. This is consistent with our findings that the SH2 domain of Vav is important for JNK activation, since PAK functions upstream of JNK activation in mast cells  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R62">62</xref> but downstream of the Vav target, Rac1  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R50">50</xref>. We also observed that the expression of Vav-C, which localizes to the plasma membrane upon Fc&#x02208;RI stimulation and inhibits Vav phosphorylation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A and 5 B), resulted in the inhibition of Vav association with SLP-76 and partial inhibition of LAT interaction with SLP-76 without affecting the tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT and SLP-76 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref> and  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. f</xref>). Since Vav, LAT, and SLP-76 can participate in a complex, and along with Rac1, are localized in GEMs, we propose that this multiprotein signaling complex is important to Vav function, including its ability to activate JNK1. In SLP-76&#x02013;deficient T cells  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R63">63</xref>, phosphorylation of the calcium response modulator, phospholipase C&#x003b3;1, was decreased&#x0003b; thus, it is also possible that a partial loss of the SLP-76 and LAT interactions in the absence of Vav may explain the defective calcium response of Vav-null cells  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R64">64</xref>. This possibility is currently being explored. The model proposed in  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> provides a possible mechanism for Vav contribution to cytoskeleton rearrangement, calcium signals, and kinase activation. By complexing with a LAT-organized multiprotein signaling complex  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R45">45</xref>, Vav activity and protein interactions may contribute to activation of Rac  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R50">50</xref>, Ras  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R10">10</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R15">15</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R45">45</xref>, and calcium signals  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R45">45</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R55">55</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R60">60</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R64">64</xref>, thus participating in cytoskeletal rearrangement, MAPK activation, and gene expression  <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref> <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs.
