Expression of Grf40 is predominant in hematopoietic cells, particularly  T cells. Grf40 binds to the SH2 domain&#x02013;containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD (SLP-76) via  its SH3 domain more tightly than Grb2. Incidentally, Grf40 binds to linker for activation of  T cells (LAT) possibly via its SH2 domain. Overexpression of wild-type Grf40 in Jurkat cells induced a significant increase of SLP-76&#x02013;dependent interleukin (IL)-2 promoter and nuclear factor of activated T cell (NF-AT) activation upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, whereas the  COOH-terminal SH3-deleted Grf40 mutant lacked any recognizable increase in IL-2 promoter  activity. Furthermore, the SH2-deleted Grf40 mutant led to a marked inhibition of these regulatory activities, the effect of which is apparently stronger than that of the SH2-deleted Grb2 mutant. Our data suggest that Grf40 is an adaptor molecule involved in TCR-mediated signaling  through a more efficient interaction than Grb2 with SLP-76 and LAT.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Grb2 family</kwd><kwd>SLP-76</kwd><kwd>T cell receptor signaling</kwd><kwd>nuclear factor of activated T cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Stimulation of the TCR initiates activation of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs)<sup>1</sup> that trigger downstream signaling pathways including calcium- and Ras- dependent events, which ultimately converge upon the  nucleus to stimulate the transcription of genes required for  proliferation and effector functions of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Phospholipase C&#x003b3;1, recruited to the plasma membrane after PTK  activation, is thought to introduce the calcium-dependent  pathway into the TCR-mediated signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).  On the other hand, the pathway for Ras activation after  PTK activation in T cells is still controversial. Grb2, an  adaptor protein containing an SH3-SH2-SH3 motif, forms  a complex with Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor,  via its NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal SH3 domain after TCR ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).  Hence, the Grb2&#x02013;Sos complex is thought to contribute to  Ras activation in T cells, although there has been no empirical evidence for this notion.</p><p>The COOH-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 has been  shown to bind to the SH2 domain&#x02013;containing leukocyte  protein of 76 kD (SLP-76), a hematopoietic cell&#x02013;specific  adaptor protein, which is tyrosine phosphorylated rapidly  after TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Mice targeted for SLP-76  gene engendered defects of double-positive T cells in the  thymus and of peripheral T cells as a consequence of impaired pre-TCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Furthermore, Jurkat subline  J14 cells lacking expression of SLP-76 exhibited defects of  both the calcium- and Ras-dependent pathways in TCR-mediated signaling. The defect of the calcium-dependent  pathway in this system is ascribed to the fact that tyrosine  phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C&#x003b3;1 are  significantly suppressed in J14 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Although the precise function of SLP-76 in Ras activation is still obscure, it is  of interest that deletion of the Grb2-binding site of SLP-76  eliminates the ability of SLP-76 to increase IL-2 promoter  activity upon stimulation with the TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In addition, SLP-76 also binds to Vav, a member of the guanine  nucleotide exchange factor family, and cotransfection with  SLP-76 and Vav into Jurkat cells induced a synergistic increase of nuclear factor of activated T cell (NF-AT) activation upon TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). These observations suggest  that SLP-76 is an indispensable mediator of TCR signaling.  On the other hand, the SH2 domain of Grb2 has been  shown to bind to linker for activation of T cells (LAT), a  ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase substrate, upon TCR stimulation,  and the LAT mutant, lacking an interaction site for the  SH2 domain, has a dominant-negative effect on TCR-stimulated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Hence Grb2, an adaptor protein, has  been considered to be implicated in TCR-mediated signaling. We here provide evidence that a new Grb2 family member, named Grf40, is involved in TCR-mediated signaling  through its more efficient interaction than Grb2 with SLP-76  and LAT.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Cloning of the cDNA.</title><p>Grf40 cDNA fragments were isolated  by a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human PHA-PBL cDNA library (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="clontech">Clontech</named-content>). The bait plasmid was constructed by insertion  of a cDNA fragment encoding the full-length human AMSH  protein (our unpublished protocol) in pAS2-1 (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="clontech">Clontech</named-content>). The  bait plasmid was transformed into the yeast strain CG1945 (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="clontech">Clontech</named-content>), followed by transformation with the human PHA-PBL  cDNA library. The transformed strains were selected on dropout  plates (Trp<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, Leu<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, His<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) with 5 mM 3-aminotriazole. Positive  colonies were subsequently tested for the expression of lacZ. One  clone was determined to contain a homologous sequence to  Grb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). To obtain the full-length cDNA, the 800-bp fragment  of the above clone was used as a probe for screening a &#x003bb;gt11  oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library of PHA-PBL. The sequences of  10 clones were identical, and two of them contained an open  reading frame coding for 330 amino acids. This sequence contains an in-frame stop codon at 114 bp upstream of the first methionine codon, and the sequence around the first methionine  (nucleotides 193&#x02013;195) matches the favorable Kozak consensus sequence. A full-length cDNA encoding Grf40 was thus isolated.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Plasmid Construction.</title><p>Grf40 cDNA was generated by PCR  using the above full-length cDNA clone as a template and subcloned into Myc-Tag-pcDNA3.1(&#x0002b;) to generate the plasmid  sequence (EQKLISEEDL). pMycGrf40-dSH3N, pMycGrf40-dSH2,  pMycGrf40-dSH3C, and pMycGrf40-dSH3NC are Myc-tagged  Grf40 mutants deleted of the SH3 domain of the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus  (amino acid position Met<sup>1</sup>&#x02013;Pro<sup>56</sup>), deleted of the SH2 domain  (amino acid position Lys<sup>57</sup>&#x02013;Thr<sup>149</sup>), of the SH3 domain of the  COOH terminus (amino acid position Ala<sup>278</sup>&#x02013;Arg<sup>330</sup>), and of the  SH3 domains of the NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH termini (amino acid positions Met<sup>1</sup>&#x02013;Pro<sup>56</sup> and Ala<sup>278</sup>&#x02013;Arg<sup>330</sup>), respectively. pMycGrb2 and  pMycGrb2-dSH2 are expression plasmids for the Myc-tagged  wild-type Grb2 and Grb2 mutant deleted of the SH2 domain  (amino acid position Trp<sup>60</sup>&#x02013;Glu<sup>152</sup>), respectively.

We have also recently  cloned a cDNA clone encoding a novel molecule, named  AMSH, which binds to STAM (our unpublished results).  To address the functional significance of AMSH, we attempted to identify molecules associated with AMSH using  the yeast two-hybrid assay system. One full-length cDNA  clone was isolated from a human PHA-PBL cDNA library.  The cDNA clone encodes a molecule homologous to  Grb2, named Grf40 (for Grb2 family member of 40 kD).  The nucleotide sequence of the Grf40 gene has been deposited with GenBank, and is available from EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ under accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF042380">AF042380</ext-link>. The deduced  amino acid sequence of Grf40 consists of 330 amino acid  residues. The schematic structure of Grf40 was compared  with Grb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and Grap, another Grb2 family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH-terminal SH3 domains and an  intermediate SH2 domain of Grf40 are highly homologous  to those of Grb2 and Grap, while a unique insert region  (amino acid position Arg<sup>156</sup>&#x02013;Arg<sup>277</sup>) containing proline/ glutamine-rich sequences was seen in Grf40 but not Grb2  and Grap (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> A). These results indicate that Grf40 is a  new member of the Grb2 family. </p><p>Various human cell lines were examined for expression  of Grf40 by immunoblotting with anti-Grf40 Ab. Two T  cell lines, MOLT-4 and Jurkat, were strongly positive for  expression of the 40-kD Grf40, and two B cell lines, Daudi  and Raji, were weakly positive, but the other cell lines, including a B cell line (Ramos), myeloid cell lines (THP-1,  TF-1, and Eol-3), and the nonhematopoietic cell lines  (HeLa and WI-26) were all negative for this expression  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> B). In contrast to Grf40, appreciable expression of  Grb2 was seen in all the cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> B). Northern blot  analyses on various human cell lines and tissues showed two  Grf40-specific transcripts at 3.5 and 1.5 kb in Jurkat,  MOLT-4, three myeloid cell lines (KU812, K562, and  M-TAT) and PHA-PBL (data not shown), and in human  immunotissues such as thymus, spleen, small intestine, and  PBL, whereas marginal levels of the transcripts were detected  in other tissues, including prostate, testis, ovary, colon, heart,  brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> C). These results suggest that Grf40, unlike  Grb2, is predominantly expressed in immunotissues and  hematopoietic cells, particularly T cells.</p><p>Since Grb2 has been shown to bind to SLP-76 and LAT,  which are 76- and 36/38-kD tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins essential for TCR-mediated signaling, respectively  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), we asked ourselves whether or not Grf40 is  also associated with SLP-76 and LAT. We detected 76- and  36/38-kD tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with Grf40 in Jurkat cells after stimulation by  TCR cross-linking with OKT3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A). We then confirmed that the 76- and 36/38-kD tyrosine-phosphorylated  proteins were SLP-76 and LAT, respectively, by stimulating Jurkat cells with OKT3. Their lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grf40 Ab, and the immunoprecipitates  were then immunoblotted with anti-LAT, anti&#x02013;SLP-76, or  anti-Grf40 Ab. Grf40 precipitated SLP-76 irrespective of  TCR stimulation, but precipitated LAT only after TCR  stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B). These results indicate the association  of Grf40 with SLP-76 and LAT in Jurkat cells. To determine the association site of Grf40 for SLP-76, we carried  out further coimmunoprecipitation assays between the various deletion mutants of Grf40 and SLP-76. COS7 cells  were transiently transfected with Myc-tagged wild-type  Grf40 and four Grf40 mutants deleted of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal  SH3 domain (Grf40-dSH3N), the COOH-terminal SH3  domain (Grf40-dSH3C), both the NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH-terminal SH3 domains (Grf40-dSH3NC), or the SH2 domain  (Grf40-dSH2). The transfected COS7 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti&#x02013;SLP-76 Ab or anti-Myc mAb, and  then immunoblotted with anti-Myc mAb or anti&#x02013;SLP-76  Ab. Wild-type Grf40 and the Grf40-dSH2 and Grf40-dSH3N  mutants were coimmunoprecipitated with SLP-76, but the  Grf40-dSH3C and Grf40-dSH3NC mutants were not tested  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> C). Conversely, SLP-76 was coimmunoprecipitated  with Grf40-dSH2, Grf40-dSH3N, and wild-type Grf40,  but not with Grf40-dSH3C and Grf40-dSH3NC mutants  (data not shown). These results indicate that the COOH-terminal SH3 domain of Grf40 is an association site for  SLP-76. We next determined the association site of SLP-76  for Grf40 by using various SLP-76 mutants. Flag-tagged  wild-type and four mutants of SLP-76 were introduced  into COS7 cells together with Myc-tagged Grf40, and then  immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with anti-Flag  and anti-Myc Abs. Myc-tagged Grf40 was coimmunoprecipitated with the SLP-76 mutants consisting of and containing the amino acid position Glu<sup>217</sup>&#x02013;Pro<sup>533</sup>, but not with  the SLP-76 mutant consisting of the amino acid position  Pro<sup>241</sup>&#x02013;Pro<sup>533</sup>. These results indicate that the Grf40 binding  site is located in the amino acid position Glu<sup>217</sup>&#x02013;Lys<sup>240</sup> of  SLP-76 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> D). This Grf40 binding site of SLP-76  almost overlaps the amino acid position Asn<sup>224</sup>&#x02013;Asp<sup>244</sup>,  which has been shown to be the Grb2 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).  On the other hand, the binding site of Grb2 for LAT has  been shown to be the SH2 domain of Grb2, which is  thought to bind to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Together with this notion, we showed that LAT is tyrosine phosphorylated and subsequently coimmunoprecipitated with Grf40 after TCR stimulation, suggesting that the  SH2 domain of Grf40 is possibly the binding site for LAT. </p><p>Since the COOH-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 has  been shown to be the binding site for SLP-76 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), we  examined the competitive binding ability between Grf40  and Grb2 to SLP-76. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with 2.5-&#x003bc;g plasmids of Myc-tagged Grf40 and  Myc-tagged Grb2 in association with different doses (0&#x02013;1.0  &#x003bc;g) of Flag-tagged SLP-76 plasmid. Their lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag mAb and then immunoblotted with anti-Myc polyclonal Ab. Coimmunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged Grf40 with SLP-76 gradually decreased  upon reducing the SLP-76 plasmid dose to 0.05 &#x003bc;g,  whereas the Myc-tagged Grb2 coimmunoprecipitation with  SLP-76 was detectable only at a 1.0-&#x003bc;g dose of SLP-76  plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A). Expression levels of the plasmids introduced were quantified by immunoblotting, confirming that  there was no significant difference in the amounts between  Myc-tagged Grf40 and Myc-tagged Grb2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A). These  results suggest the possibility that Grf40 associated much  stronger with SLP-76 than did Grb2. To confirm this further, COS7 cells were transiently transfected with low  doses of SLP-76 plasmid (0.2 &#x003bc;g) and Myc-Grf40 plasmid  (2.5 &#x003bc;g) together with various doses (0&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;g) of Myc-tagged Grb2 plasmid. Their lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag mAb and then immunoblotted with  anti-Myc polyclonal Ab. Even when up to 10-&#x003bc;g plasmid  doses of Myc-tagged Grb2 were cotransfected, coimmunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged Grf40 with SLP-76 was still  unchanged (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B). Furthermore, although the increased  expression of Myc-tagged Grb2 was dependent on its plasmid dose, which was considerably higher than that of Grf40  at a 10-&#x003bc;g plasmid dose of Myc-tagged Grb2, Myc-tagged  Grb2 was not coimmunoprecipitated with SLP-76 (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B). These results indicate that Grf40 competes with Grb2  in its binding to SLP-76, and the binding affinity of Grf40 to  SLP-76 is apparently higher than that of Grb2. Since the  SLP-76 mutant deleted of the Grb2 binding site, which  overlaps the Grf40 binding site, failed to increase IL-2 promoter activity upon TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), it is possible  that not only Grb2 but also Grf40 plays a critical role in the  SLP-76&#x02013;dependent increase in IL-2 promoter activity. </p><p>To address the functional significance of Grf40 in TCR-mediated signaling, we performed luciferase assays with reporter genes containing the IL-2 promoter and the NF-AT  binding domain. Overexpression of wild-type Grf40 did  not lead to either basal or TCR-mediated activation of the  IL-2 promoter and NF-AT (data not shown). Since Grf40  interacts with SLP-76 in Jurkat cells, and overexpression of  SLP-76 is known to augment TCR-mediated stimulation  of the IL-2 promoter and NF-AT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), we used  Jurkat cells transiently transfected with SLP-76 to examine  the effect of Grf40 in TCR-mediated signaling. Transfections of wild-type Grf40 and Grf40-dSH3N mutant into  Jurkat cells overexpressing SLP-76 led to significant increases  in IL-2 promoter activity upon stimulation with OKT3 plus  PMA, whereas transfection of Grf40-dSH2 mutant induced  a marked inhibition of IL-2 promoter activity compared  with transfection of an empty vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A). These results  indicate that Grf40-dSH2 mutant has a dominant-negative  effect in TCR stimulation, suggesting that the SH2 domain  of Grf40 interacts with an essential molecule for TCR-mediated signaling, which is possibly LAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Similar results  were obtained in NF-AT luciferase assays with Jurkat cells  stimulated with OKT3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B). Furthermore, the Grf40  mutants (Grf40-dSH3C and Grf40-dSH3NC) deleted of the  COOH-terminal SH3 domain, which is the binding site  for SLP-76, also lost their ability to increase IL-2 promoter  activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A), suggesting that a Grf40&#x02013;SLP-76 complex  formation is required for SLP-76&#x02013;dependent TCR stimulation. These results indicate that Grf40 is involved in signaling  the stimulation of the IL-2 promoter and NF-AT activities  mediated by OKT3 and PMA. </p><p>Since Grb2 has also been considered to be involved in  the modulation of TCR-mediated signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>),  we compared the functional significance of Grf40 and  Grb2 in TCR-mediated stimulation of IL-2 promoter activity. Jurkat cells overexpressing SLP-76 were transfected  with the wild-types and SH2 deletion mutants of Grf40  and Grb2, in association with an IL-2 promoter&#x02013;driven luciferase construct. They were stimulated with OKT3 plus  PMA, and assayed for luciferase activity. An appreciable enhancement of IL-2 promoter activity was seen with wild-type Grf40, but scarcely with wild-type Grb2, whereas  Grf40-dSH2 mutant showed a marked dominant-negative  effect in the IL-2 luciferase assay compared with Grb2-dSH2  mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A). The plasmid dose dependency in the IL-2  luciferase assay was compared between the Grf40-dSH2 and  Grb2-dSH2 mutants. The suppressive effects on the luciferase activities were significantly stronger in Grf40-dSH2  mutant than Grb2-dSH2 mutant at various plasmid doses  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B). These results indicate that Grf40 is involved in  TCR-mediated signaling more effectively than Grb2. This  conclusion is in accordance with the observation of greater  binding affinity of Grf40 to SLP-76 compared with Grb2. </p><p>This study showed a critical involvement of Grf40 in the  SLP-76&#x02013;dependent signaling mediated by the TCR. One  might consider the possibility that Grf40 mutants exert  their effects in TCR-mediated signaling by altering expression levels of SLP-76. However, this possibility is negligible  because the expression of pCX-SLP76 was confirmed to be  unaffected by transient expression of Grf40, Grb2, and their  mutants in COS7 cells (data not shown). Hence, the interaction of Grf40 with SLP-76 and LAT is thought to be  critical for TCR-mediated signaling.</p><p>The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 is known to be  a binding site for Sos, a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange  factor, which has been considered to be involved in Ras  activation upon TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). We confirmed the  association of Grb2 with Sos in Jurkat cells; however, a  complex formation between Grf40 and Sos was undetectable in these cells (data not shown). Therefore, we suspect  that Grf40 does not direct the Ras activation signaling mediated by the TCR. However, Grf40 contributes to TCR-mediated activation of the IL-2 promoter and NF-AT  more effectively than Grb2, suggesting the critical involvement of Grf40 in TCR-mediated signaling. In this context,  it is of interest that SLP-76 associated with Grf40 also binds  to Vav, a Rac/Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and  that the interaction between SLP-76 and Vav has been shown  to participate in IL-2 gene activation upon TCR stimulation  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). These observations provide a model pathway in which  activated ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase after TCR ligation phosphorylates LAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), which then binds to the preformed  Grf40&#x02013;SLP-76 complex and recruits it to ZAP-70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), which  further phosphorylates SLP-76 to be associated with Vav,  leading to the downstream signaling of the TCR.</p><p>Northern blot and immunoblot analyses revealed that  Grf40 is expressed predominantly in immunotissues and hematopoietic cells, particularly T cells, in contrast to Grb2.  Such restricted distribution of Grf40 may reflect the more efficient involvement of Grf40 in TCR-mediated signaling  compared with Grb2. Although Grap has also been shown  to be specific for hematopoietic and lymphocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>),  the functional significance of Grap is still unknown.</p><p>The genome sequence of GRB2L has been registered  in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ (under accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="Z82206">Z82206</ext-link>),  which contains the entire sequence of Grf40. Since GRB2L  has been mapped to human chromosome 22q12, Grf40 is  thought to have the same chromosomal location. Furthermore, cDNA clones identical to Grf40 were reported as  Grap2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), and human Gads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and their mouse homologues, named Mona (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) and mouse Gads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), were also reported after the submission of this paper. Although the report  regarding human Gads showed similar results as our study,  they did not show any comparative study between Gads and  Grb2. We here show evidence suggesting that Grf40 plays a  more critical role in the TCR-mediated signaling than Grb2.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic structure and expression of Grf40.
