Molecular mechanisms are thus required that ensure spatially restricted and process-specific RhoA activation. For many fundamental processes, including assembly of the epithelial junctional complex, such mechanisms are still unknown. Here we show that p114RhoGEF is a junction-associated protein that drives RhoA signalling at the junctional complex and regulates tight junction assembly and epithelial morphogenesis. p114RhoGEF is required for RhoA activation at cell-cell junctions, and its depletion stimulates non-junctional Rho signalling and induction of myosin phosphorylation along the basal domain. Depletion of GEF-H1, a RhoA activator inhibited by junctional recruitment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, does not reduce junction-associated RhoA activation. p114RhoGEF associates with a complex containing myosin II, Rock II and the junctional adaptor cingulin, indicating that p114RhoGEF is a component of a junction-associated Rho signalling module that drives spatially restricted activation of RhoA to regulate junction formation and epithelial morphogenesis.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source country="United Kingdom">Wellcome Trust : </funding-source><award-id>084678 || WT</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P5">A particular RhoGTPase can be part of signalling mechanisms that stimulate opposing processes and, at a given point in time, may be activated at one subcellullar site and inactivated at another. Orchestration of RhoGTPase signalling thus requires mechanisms that regulate activity in space and time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>. Activation of GTPases is catalysed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and inactivation by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>. In epithelial cells, the RhoGTPase family member RhoA is activated at cell junctions upon initiation of cell-cell adhesion and, concomitantly, downregulated in other parts of the cells, contributing to reduced cell spreading and stress fibre formation, and inhibition of proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>. Junctional RhoA activation drives formation of tight and adherens junctions, and is required to maintain junctional integrity, processes that are mediated by the actinomyosin cytoskeleton; however, how RhoA is activated at junctions is not understood. GEF-H1, a GEF for RhoA, localises to tight junctions, the most apical component of the junctional complex; yet, it is not required for junction formation, and junctional recruitment leads to its inactivation and inhibition of the Rho-stimulated transcription factor ZONAB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>. GEF-H1 activation is indeed required for junction dissociation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>.</p><p id="P6">We identified p114RhoGEF as a regulator of epithelial differentiation and junction assembly using a functional siRNA screen. A p114RhoGEF-specific antibody was found to detect a 114kD protein that disappeared upon transfection of specific siRNAs in the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 and in immortalised human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). By immunofluorescence, this antibody stained the junctional complex and a cytoplasmic pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Both stainings disappeared upon p114RhoGEF depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Junctional p114RhoGEF overlapped with occludin, a tight junction protein, but not E-cadherin, an adherens junction component, indicating that p114RhoGEF associates with the apical junctional complex and tight junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>).</p><p id="P7">p114RhoGEF is a widely expressed gene and, in vitro, functions as a specific activator of RhoA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>. Accordingly, depletion of p114RhoGEF resulted in reduced levels of active RhoA in HCE cells without significantly affecting Rac and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We next determined the effect of p114RhoGEF depletion on the junctional complex by staining for tight and adherens junction markers. In the columnar epithelial cell line Caco-2, p114RhoGEF depletion resulted in flatter cells and in a warped appearance of the junctional staining of ZO-1 and, to a lesser degree, &#x003b2;-catenin, as well as reduced perijunctional f-actin and increased formation of stress fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g,h</xref>). The phenotype of HCE cells was similar but, as these are not columnar, no flattening was observed. Strikingly, ZO-1 staining was disrupted, indicating a defect in tight junction assembly. Comparable phenotypes were observed when cells were stained for other tight junction markers and when p114RhoGEF was depleted with individual siRNAs or a different type of siRNA pool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). p114RhoGEF is thus required for normal junction formation and actin organisation.</p><p id="P9">We next investigated if Caco-2 cells depleted of p114RhoGEF form functional epithelial barriers by testing the permeability properties of the monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 a - c</xref>). We performed calcium switch assays to monitor <italic>de novo</italic> junction formation and measured transepithelial electrical resistance, a measure of barrier integrity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>. Depletion of p114RhoGEF strongly attenuated barrier formation and only reached 40% of the values of control cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Paracellular diffusion of fluorescent 4 and 70 kD dextran was still high in such cultures, indicating that tight junctions remained leaky (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Morphological analysis of cells incubated for different times with calcium revealed that p114RhoGEF depletion did not affect initial spreading and initiation of cell-cell contacts as ZO-1 accumulated at forming junctions already after 1 hour and f-actin staining revealed spread cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d,e,f</xref>). However, ZO-1 staining remained discontinuous and warped even after 24 hours. Similar observations were made for other junctional markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a</xref>). Thus, p114RhoGEF is not required for spreading and initiation of adhesion, but for junctional maturation. As expected, GEF-H1 depleted cells spread more slowly as round cells were still detected after 1 hour with calcium but, once junctions started to form, they established morphologically normal junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). GEF-H1 depletion did also not affect junction formation in HCE cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2b,c</xref>). This is in agreement with previous observations indicating that GEF-H1 is not required for junction formation but cell spreading<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>.</p><p id="P11">p114RhoGEF localised to forming junctions already after 30 minutes together with myosin II, a target of Rho signalling during junctional maturation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Myosin II recruitment to cell contacts was attenuated by 114RhoGEF depletion and, instead, showed increased association with stress fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2d</xref>). GEF-H1 was also not recruited to cell contacts and may hence contribute to the increase in stress fibres along the base of the cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>.</p><p id="P12">We next analysed whether p114RhoGEF regulates epithelial morphogenesis using three-dimensional culture systems that allow the formation of polarised cysts with a central lumen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>. p114RhoGEF was depleted by siRNA transfection in Caco-2 cells and expression of shRNAs in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2e</xref>). Depletion affected both epithelial cell types, resulting in a disorganised appearance of the cysts that often developed multiple lumens and an irregular distribution of ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The apical marker podocalyxin still accumulated in lumens, suggesting p114RhoGEF depletion did not cause a loss of polarity but a disorganised three-dimensional arrangement of the cells.</p><p id="P13">We next investigated whether p114RhoGEF stimulates Rho signalling at the junctional complex. We used a FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer)-based RhoA biosensor to localise RhoA activation in live cells after depletion of either p114RhoGEF or, as an additional control, GEF-H1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>. In control cells, the most intense FRET signal, indicating active RhoA, was observed along cell-cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Depletion of p114RhoGEF led to a redistribution of the FRET signal away from cell junctions and was increased throughout the cells including the basal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3a</xref>). Depletion of GEF-H1 did not affect the junctional FRET signal. Comparable results were obtained with HCE and Caco-2 cells as well as during junction formation, indicating that p114RhoGEF is required for spatially restricted RhoA activation at cell junctions.</p><p id="P14">One of the main targets of RhoA signalling is phosphorylation of the light chain of myosin II (MLC), leading to myosin activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>. Therefore we next investigated the role of p114RhoGEF in MLC phosphorylation. In control cells, myosin staining was found along the junctional complex and, to a lesser extent, along the basal membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). Depletion of p114RhoGEF led to a redistribution of myosin from junctions to stress fibres. Phosphorylated MLC was found along cell junctions in control cells and concentrated on stress fibres in the absence of p114RhoGEF, indicating that myosin activation was shifted to the basal domain. GEF-H1 depletion did not affect the distribution of phosphorylated MLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Depletion of p114RhoGEF also inhibited the appearance of phosphorylated MLC during junction assembly, indicating that it is required for myosin activation during junction formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4a</xref>). p114RhoGEF depletion did not alter total levels of phosphorylated MLC in Caco-2 cells and only slightly reduced them in HCE cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4b</xref>). Phosphorylation of the Rock substrate myosin light chain phosphatase was also unaltered. These observations suggest that p114RhoGEF is required for the spatially restricted activation of RhoA signalling and myosin activation at cell-cell junctions, and that its absence leads to defective junction assembly, cell spreading, increased non-junctional RhoA signalling and myosin activation.</p><p id="P15">If p114RhoGEF regulates activation of junctional myosin, overexpression should induce junctional actinomyosin contraction and this should require a functional GEF domain. Hence, we substituted a conserved tyrosine residue in the Dbl domain necessary for GEF activity (p114RhoGEFY260A). Analogous mutations were previously shown to inactivate the GEF activities of GEF-H1 and Lbc<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>. Cells expressing VSV-tagged p114RhoGEF had increased active RhoA levels and increased levels of phosphorylated MLC whereas expression of the mutant had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4c</xref>). Morphologically, expression of p114RhoGEF-VSV led to an apically contracted, rounded morphology with increased perijunctional f-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f,g</xref>). In stably transfected MDCK cells, upregulation of the active p114RhoGEF led to increased phosphorylated MLC at cell junctions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4d</xref>). Expression of active, but not inactive p114RhoGEF led to Rock activity-dependent rounding and monolayer contraction leading to monolayer gaps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4e</xref>). Cell compaction was particularly striking in the normally flat HCE cells, which developed an apically elongated, dome-like appearance with a contracted junctional ring, but was also evident in Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f,g, h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5a</xref>). These effects required Rho activation as they were not observed when p114RhoGEFY260A-VSV was expressed. Similarly, only active human p114RhoGEF could induce recruitment of junctional markers in depleted MDCK cells, and expression of the inactive exchange factor in HCE cells interfered with the normal junctional distribution of ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5b,c,d</xref>). Overexpression of GEF-H1 did not induce contraction of the perijunctional actinomyosin ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). These data indicate that junctional contraction is a p114RhoGEF-specific function and requires a functional GEF domain.</p><p id="P16">As p114RhoGEF regulates the junctional recruitment of myosin, we next tested whether the two proteins are part of a common complex. p114RhoGEF immunoprecipitates contained myosin IIA and the RhoA effector Rock II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Cingulin, a tight junction-associated adaptor known to form a complex with myosin and to regulate RhoA signalling, was also coprecipitating with p114RhoGEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>. Coprecipitation of myosin IIA, cingulin and RockII was not detected when cells were not allowed to form junctions by culturing in low calcium medium. Cingulin can also bind GEF-H1; however, coprecipitation of the two GEFs was not observed (not shown), suggesting that they are part of distinct complexes.</p><p id="P17">We next used GST fusion proteins of p114RhoGEF to map the domain of p114RhoGEF required for these interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5b</xref>). We found that full-length p114RhoGEF pulled down myosin IIA, cingulin and Rock II; however, the efficiency was low possibly because the full length fusion protein was difficult to express. The PH domain alone pulled down myosin and cingulin efficiently. Pull down of Rock II was not efficient, suggesting that Rho activation might be needed for efficient Rock recruitment.</p><p id="P18">We next asked whether cingulin is required for recruitment of p114RhoGEF to tight junctions. Depletion of cingulin indeed inhibited junctional recruitment of p114RhoGEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c,d,e</xref>). In HCE cells, cingulin was required for tight junction formation: depletion led to a loss of junctional staining not only of p114RhoGEF, but also of ZO-1, occludin and GEF-H1, but not of components of adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6a,b,c</xref>). Cingulin and p114RhoGEF also colocalised by confocal microscopy, and overexpression of cingulin led to a redistribution of p114RhoGEF and myosin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6d,e</xref>). Cingulin depletion also attenuated p114RhoGEF and myosin IIA recruitment, and MLC phosphorylation at forming junctions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6f</xref>). Similarly, cingulin was required for myosin recruitment and MLC phosphorylation in HCE cells, and for normal Rho activation at cell junctions in Caco-2 and HCE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). Cingulin is thus important for the cellular distribution of p114RhoGEF and for activation of RhoA signalling at cell junctions.</p><p id="P19">Our study shows that p114RhoGEF regulates spatially restricted activation of RhoA at epithelial junctions, driving junction assembly and junctional actinomyosin activation. RhoA signalling is well-known to be a crucial regulator of junction assembly and function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>; however, the GEF that activates RhoA at cell junctions had thus far not been known. p114RhoGEF forms a functional signalling module containing Rock II and myosin, two proteins that are known to regulate junction dynamics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>. Junctional recruitment requires cingulin, an adaptor protein that is known to impact on RhoA signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>.</p><p id="P20">p114RhoGEF regulates spatially restricted RhoA activation at cell-cell contacts in different types of epithelial cells. In agreement with previous results, depletion of GEF-H1, which is not required for junction formation and is inactive at junctions, did not affect junctional Rho signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>. Hence, p114RhoGEF and GEF-H1 represent two opposing pathways of RhoA regulation at cell junctions: the former is recruited to the forming junctional complex and promotes junctional maturation and contraction of the actinomyosin belt; the latter is recruited and turned off, contributing to inhibition of confluence-induced RhoA signalling and cell proliferation.</p><p id="P21">Depletion of p114RhoGEF did not only inhibit RhoA activation at junctions, but led to increased non-junctional Rho activation and increased MLC phosphorylation along the basal domain. Paradoxically as this may seem, it supports the specificity of p114RhoGEF for junctional Rho signalling and its importance for junction formation. RhoA activity is downregulated in response to cell confluence; hence, interfering with junction formation stimulates RhoA signalling in the rest of the cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>. As junctions do not form normally in p114RhoGEF depleted cells, GEF-H1 is also not recruited normally and, hence, is likely to contribute to overall RhoA activation in such cells. GEF-H1 indeed induces stress fibres in response to stimuli such as TNF&#x003b1;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>. However, there are other mechanisms that contribute to inhibition of RhoA signalling at cell confluence, such as regulation of p190RhoGAP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> or, possibly, the junction-associated GAP myosin-IXb<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, and depletion of GEF-H1 in addition to p114RhoGEF was not sufficient to block stress fibre formation (not shown).</p><p id="P22">The junction-associated actinomyosin cytoskeleton is crucial for the regulation of junction dynamics and function, and also drives apical constriction and tissue remodeling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>. p114RhoGEF thus associates with and activates a Rho signalling module that is central to epithelial junction formation and morphogenesis. This is supported by our data that shows p114RhoGEF regulated junction assembly and epithelial morphogenesis in three-dimensional culture systems. Overexpression of p114RhoGEF induced actinomyosin contraction, suggesting that this Rho GEF may also be important for developmental processes requiring apical constriction.</p><p id="P23">Our data thus show that p114RhoGEF represents a RhoA regulator central to epithelial barrier formation and morphogenesis that forms a junction-associated signalling module. Given the physiological roles of junctional RhoA signalling, it will be important to determine how p114RhoGEF becomes stimulated during physiological and developmental processes to drive spatially restricted Rho signalling at cell junctions.</p><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS33680-supplement-1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e474" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>2</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS33680-supplement-2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e478" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>SJT is supported by a Fight for Sight Studentship.
