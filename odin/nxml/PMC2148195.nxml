The oncogene v<italic>-src</italic> appears to cause acute closure  of gap junction channels. Tyr265 in the COOH-terminal  tail of connexin 43 (Cx43) has been implicated as a potential target of v<italic>-src</italic>, although v<italic>-src</italic> action has also  been associated with changes in serine phosphorylation. We have investigated the mechanism of this acute  regulation through mutagenesis of Cx43 expressed in  <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte pairs. Truncations of the COOH-terminal domain led to an almost complete loss of response of Cx43 to v<italic>-src</italic>, but this was restored by coexpression of the independent COOH-terminal polypeptide. This suggests a ball and chain gating mechanism,  similar to the mechanism proposed for pH gating of  Cx43, and K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel inactivation. Surprisingly, we  found that v<italic>-src</italic> mediated gating of Cx43 did not require the tyrosine site, but did seem to depend on the  presence of two potential SH3 binding domains and the  mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation sites within them. Further point mutagenesis and  pharmacological studies in normal rat kidney (NRK)  cells implicated MAP kinase in the gating response to  v<italic>-src</italic>, while the stable binding of v<italic>-src</italic> to Cx43 (in part  mediated by SH3 domains) did not correlate with its  ability to mediate channel closure. This suggests a common link between closure of gap junctions by v<italic>-src</italic>  and other mitogens, such as EGF and lysophosphatidic  acid (LPA).</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>intercellular coupling</kwd><kwd>MAP kinase</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>v<italic>-src</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>G<sc>ap</sc> junctions are composed of transmembrane channels that allow low molecular weight molecules to  move directly between the cytoplasms of opposed  cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Loewenstein, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Beyer et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Goldberg et  al., 1998</xref>).

Support for  the hypothesis that reduced coupling plays a contributory  role in cell transformation is provided by several studies  in which restoration of cell coupling through transfection  of connexin cDNA into communication-deficient transformed cell lines leads to normalization of cell growth  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Eghbali et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mehta et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Naus et al., 1992</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Rose et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Mesnil et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Communication through gap junctions is known to be  sensitive to a variety of physiological stimuli, such as  changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Rose et al., 1993</xref>), pH  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Turin and Warner, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">Spray et al., 1981</xref>), transjunctionally applied voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Harris et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bennett and  Verselis, 1992</xref>), and direct expression of some protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Stagg and Fletcher, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Goodenough et al., 1996</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Lau et al., 1996</xref>).

The  disruption of intercellular coupling through gap junctions  by temperature-sensitive variants of pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> is an early  event that precedes phenotypic transformation of cell lines  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Atkinson et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Azarnia et al., 1988</xref>), suggesting a  possible causative link between the two events.</p><p>The rapid reduction in junctional coupling in response  to pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> expression was correlated with an accumulation of connexin 43 (Cx43) phosphorylated on tyrosine  residues, while cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature contained only serine-phosphorylated Cx43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Crow et  al., 1992</xref>). This was supported by studies in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>  oocytes where tyrosine phosphorylation of Cx43 was correlated with a dramatic drop in conductance induced by  injection of pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> cRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Swenson et al., 1990</xref>). Furthermore, they found that this uncoupling response to  pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> could be largely eliminated by a point mutation of  Cx43, Y265F.</p><p>Phosphorylation of connexins by various protein kinases  has been implicated in the regulation of gap junctions at  multiple levels. These include the assembly of gap junctions from connexons in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Musil et al.,  1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Musil and Goodenough, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Lampe, 1994</xref>), connexin degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Oh et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Elvira et al., 1993</xref>), and  direct effects on gap junction channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Berthoud et al.,  1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Moreno et al., 1994</xref>). Direct modulation of Cx43  channels by kinases has been associated with reduction in  single channel conductance associated with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dependent protein kinase (PKC) activity or decrease in channel  open probability (P<sub>o</sub>) associated with v<italic>-src</italic> expression  (Moreno, A.P., and B.J. Nicholson, manuscript submitted  for publication). Several serine residues on the distal portion of the COOH-terminal domain of Cx43 (aa365&#x02013;382)  have been suggested to be the target sites of PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Saez et  al., 1993</xref>), while Tyr265 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Swenson et al., 1990</xref>), and possibly Tyr247 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Lau et al., 1996</xref>), have been implicated as targets of pp60<sup>v-<italic>src</italic></sup>. Tyr265, presumably in the phosphorylated form, has been shown to be important for binding of  pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> to Cx43, as has the second of two proline-rich, putative SH3 binding domains in the COOH-tail of Cx43  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Kanemitsu et al., 1997</xref>). Other studies have also identified  serines 255, 279, and 282 as mitogen-activated protein  (MAP) kinase phosphorylation sites on Cx43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Warn-Cramer et al., 1996</xref>). These sites, or a subset of them, have  been demonstrated to be phosphorylated by MAP kinase  during EGF-induced disruption of cell coupling, and thus  have also been implicated as mediators of gap junction  gating important in the regulation of cell division.</p><p>The underlying mechanisms that mediate closure of the  gap junction channel in response to several stimuli are not  well understood. In terms of voltage gating, chimeras of  Cx32 and 26 were used to implicate the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal, first  transmembrane (M1), and first extracellular (E1) domains  as the voltage sensor of gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Verselis et al.,  1994</xref>), while a conserved proline residue in M2 has been  implicated in transduction of response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Suchyna et al.,  1993</xref>). Voltage gating parameters can also be influenced  by other parts of the sequence, e.g., the second extracellular loop (E2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Verselis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Nicholson et al., 1998</xref>).  This involvement of dispersed domains suggests that voltage gating may involve a global conformational change in  the channel. In contrast to this general conformational  change, pH mediated gating has been associated with the  discrete COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Cx43 in a  particle and receptor or, ball and chain, model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Morley  et al., 1996</xref>) similar to the inactivation of K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Hoshi et al., 1990</xref>). A similar model has been suggested  for insulin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) induced  Cx43 gap junction closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Homma et al., 1998</xref>). The implication of sites on the COOH-terminal domain of Cx43  in its regulation by several kinases raises the question of  the degree to which phosphorylation and chemically (i.e.,  pH) induced gating mechanisms may share common elements. We have sought to approach this question in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes through an extensive series of mutants. These  demonstrate that, like pH gating, pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> mediated channel closure also appears to occur via a ball and chain  mechanism. Surprisingly, this appears not to require phosphorylation of tyrosines, which may be more important in  channel assembly. In contrast, channel gating depends on  several serines that have been implicated as sites of MAP  kinase phosphorylation. Indeed, inhibition of MAP kinase  activation prevents cell uncoupling by v<italic>-src</italic>, supporting  the notion that MAP kinase is an important effector of  v<italic>-src</italic> in Cx43 channel closure.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Construction of Cx43 Mutants</title><p>Rat Cx43 cDNA (provided by Dr. Eric Beyer) was subcloned into the  PGEM 7Zf (&#x0002b;) vector (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="promega">Promega Corp.</named-content>) at the EcoRI site. The deletion  mutant of Cx43 &#x00394;245 was made by PCR using primers incorporating a  stop codon TGA at amino acid 245, before subcloning into the pBluescript IISK (&#x0002b;) vector (Stratagene). The cDNA encoding the COOH-tail  of Cx43 244&#x02013;382 was designed by mutating the codon 5&#x02032; to amino acid 245  to an ATG through PCR amplification, followed by subcloning into the  pBluescript IISK (&#x0002b;). Mutation at this site also created a consensus  Kozak site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Kozak, 1986</xref>) for translation initiation. The &#x00394;241&#x02013;280 mutant  was made in the PGEM 7Zf (&#x0002b;) vector by PCR using outer universal  primers to nucleotides 225&#x02013;243 and 902&#x02013;922 of the wild-type sequence,  and forward and reverse mutagenic primers. The mutagenic primers were  complementary to nucleotides 5&#x02032;-712 GATCGCGTG 720-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-841  ATGTCTCCTC 850-3&#x02032;, thus causing the intervening 120 nucleotides to be  looped out (making a 40 amino acid deletion). The double point mutants,  S255/257A, S279/282A, P253/256A, and P277/280A were also made by  PCR using the outer universal primers, and forward and reverse mutagenic primers that mutated both codons. The quadruple serine mutant  (S255/257/279/282A) was created by using the mutant S279/282A as the  template, and primers that mutate S255 and S257 sites. Tyrosine mutants  of Cx43, Y265F, and Y265/247F were constructed in a similar way from a  Cx43 template containing an HA tag at the 3&#x02032; end. All other mutants were  kindly provided by Drs.

It is conceivable  that such gating could be achieved by initiation of a propagated conformational change, or alternatively, by mediating an interaction between discrete domains of the connexin protein that leads to the occlusion of the channel. To  distinguish between models, we examined the responses to  v<italic>-src</italic> of a series of Cx43 truncations and site directed mutants of the COOH-terminal domain. This region had  been previously implicated in pH gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Liu et al., 1993</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Ek-Vitorin et al., 1996</xref>), responses to IGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Homma et al.,  1998</xref>), and phosphorylation by and binding to v<italic>-src</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Swenson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Warn-Cramer et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>All constructs (with one exception, see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B) were  expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte pairs that were first microinjected with wild-type or mutant connexin cRNA that had  been titrated to produce similar levels of conductance, and  in most cases, protein levels (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Preinjection of an  antisense oligonucleotide to <italic>Xenopus</italic> Cx38 &#x0223c;4 d before  the initial cRNA injection was used to effectively eliminate contributions from endogenous connexin. Paired oocytes were allowed to form stable conductance levels (usually after &#x0223c;16 h of pairing) before secondary injection of  cRNA for pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup>. The effects of this secondary injection  on intercellular conductance were assessed after 6 h and  expressed as a fractional decrement of the conductance recorded from the same oocyte pair before introduction of  v<italic>-src</italic> cRNA. In some experiments, comparable results  were also obtained after incubations as short as 3 h. With  this strategy, each oocyte pair serves as its own control,  thereby reducing effects of variability between cells. Control injections of H<sub>2</sub>O caused no change in conductance  over the time frame of our recordings.  </p><p>To determine if connexin turnover could play a role  during the duration of our experimental paradigm, we  measured the half-life of Cx43 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes as described in Materials and Methods. In oocytes, this proved  to be &#x0223c;22 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), or over four times that seen in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Fallon and Goodenough, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Musil et al.,  1990</xref>). Initial experiments used a cold methionine chase in  concert with cycloheximide treatment to stop synthesis of  new protein. Given reports that cycloheximide itself could  lead to stabilization of Cx43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Musil and Roberts, 1998</xref>), we  also performed some experiments in the absence of cycloheximide. This resulted in an even larger estimate of half-life (&#x0223c;30 h), a result that probably indicates that incorporation of labeled methionine into newly synthesized  proteins was not completely blocked by cold chase alone.  These measurements demonstrate that our strategy allows  us to focus on the gating of established channels during the  3&#x02013;6-h time period employed, as contributions from protein  turnover could be minimal. </p></sec><sec><title>pp60<sup>v-src</sup> Induces Closure of Cx43 Gap-junctional  Channels Through a Ball and Chain Mechanism</title><p>As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Swenson et al., 1990</xref>), expression  of pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> in both opposed oocytes caused a dramatic  drop (200&#x02013;500-fold) in conductance formed by wild-type  Cx43 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Unilateral injection of v<italic>-src</italic> RNA decreased  the conductance by &#x0223c;50-fold (data not shown), a result  consistent with the finding that activation of v<italic>-src</italic> causes a  reduction in P<sub>o</sub> of Cx43 channels (Moreno, A.P., and B.J.  Nicholson, manuscript submitted for publication). In contrast, pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> decreased conductance of Cx32 coupled oocytes by only 37 &#x000b1; 5% (see Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), and cultured  cells by &#x0223c;30% (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). A similar effect of v<italic>-src</italic> was  seen in Cx26 expressing oocytes (data not shown). As  noted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Swenson et al. (1990)</xref>, Cx32 contains no tyrosine  targets for the v<italic>-src</italic> kinase, or secondary sites such as  consensus serine phosphorylation sites for MAP kinase.  Therefore, the decrement in Cx32 and Cx26 conductances  mediated by v<italic>-src</italic> is likely to reflect non-gap junction&#x02013;specific effects on coupling, e.g., the well-characterized perturbation of adhesion to both substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">Xing et al., 1994</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Takeda et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hanks and Polte, 1997</xref>) and cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Matsuyoshi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Behrens et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Hamaguchi et al.,  1993</xref>) by v<italic>-src</italic> expression.    </p><p>Truncation of Cx43 at residue 245 (&#x00394;245; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) virtually eliminated the v<italic>-src</italic> response (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This confirmed  that target elements of v<italic>-src</italic> reside between residues 245  and 382 on the COOH-terminal tail of Cx43. Dramatically, the sensitivity of Cx43 &#x00394;245 to v<italic>-src</italic> was largely restored when cRNA encoding the COOH-terminal tail of  Cx43 (244&#x02013;382) was coinjected with pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> cRNA. No  drop in conductance was shown when the COOH-terminal  peptide was coexpressed with Cx43 &#x00394;245 in the absence of  v<italic>-src</italic> (data not shown). Thus, the COOH-tail of Cx43 can  function as an independent domain that can occlude the  channel upon expression of v<italic>-src</italic>, reminiscent of the ball  and chain mechanism proposed for K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Hoshi et al., 1990</xref>), as well as pH gating and insulin-mediated gating of Cx43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Morley et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Homma et  al., 1998</xref>). The COOH-tail domain appears to show specificity for the Cx43 channel, as expression of the Cx43  COOH-terminal peptide failed to induce a drop in conductance in response to v<italic>-src</italic> in Cx32 expressing oocytes  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). </p></sec><sec><title>Sequences from 241 to 280 of Cx43 Are Required for  pp60<sup>v-src</sup> Gating of Cx43</title><p>Insights into the specific molecular mechanism of how  the COOH-peptide can mediate v<italic>-src</italic> induced gating of  Cx43 requires a knowledge of which sequences within the  COOH-terminal 138 residues that were removed in the  Cx43 &#x00394;245 construct are necessary. Initial indications that  more than one site might be involved were provided when  a less severe truncation of Cx43 at residue 257 (Cx43  &#x00394;257) was tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This truncation had previously  been shown to eliminate the more sensitive pH gating response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Liu et al., 1993</xref>) and insulin induced channel closure of Cx43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Homma et al., 1998</xref>). However, it caused  only partial reduction of the v<italic>-src</italic> induced gating of Cx43  compared with that seen with Cx43 &#x00394;245 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). As was  the case with more severe truncation, the partial loss of  v<italic>-src</italic> gating seen with Cx43 &#x00394;257 was restored by addition  of cRNA encoding the missing COOH-terminal fragment  (residue 258&#x02013;382). This shorter COOH-terminal fragment,  however, only partially restored the response of more severely truncated Cx43 &#x00394;245 construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), suggesting  that the 12 missing residues from 245&#x02013;257 are important in  this process.</p><p>In a more systematic approach, we examined a series of  20 residue deletions in the COOH-terminal domain of  Cx43 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Deletions between 280 and 320 had no effect on v<italic>-src</italic> induced gating of Cx43 channels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).  However, two constructs, &#x00394;241&#x02013;260 and &#x00394;261&#x02013;280, showed  significantly reduced sensitivity to v<italic>-src</italic>. The first deletion  construct, &#x00394;241&#x02013;260, included the 12-residue site identified from the truncations, although the latter deletion,  &#x00394;261&#x02013;280, showed a more marked effect. A combined deletion from 241 to 280 (&#x00394;241&#x02013;280) resulted in a greater loss  of sensitivity to v<italic>-src</italic>, yielding a response close to the negative control of Cx32 expressing oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This region includes two proline-rich, putative SH3 binding  domains (253&#x02013;256 and 277&#x02013;283), along with all of the putative MAP kinase sites (S255, S279, and S282; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Warn-Cramer et al., 1996</xref>), as well as Tyr265 and Tyr247, putative targets of v<italic>-src</italic> kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Swenson et al., 1990</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Lau et al., 1996</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Since the response of &#x00394;241&#x02013;280 to  v<italic>-src</italic> is not significantly different than that of the &#x00394;245  truncated mutant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.01), it is reasonable to propose  that relevant residues for v<italic>-src</italic> mediated gating are located  in this region. Furthermore, both of the 20 residue regions  identified in the initial deletion series (each containing one  of the proline-rich regions and a subset of the serine and  tyrosine phosphorylation sites) contribute cooperatively,  or at least additively, to v<italic>-src</italic> gating of Cx43. This was consistent with the comparison of &#x00394;245 and &#x00394;257 truncations  of Cx43 described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Tyr265 and Tyr247 Are Not Required for Gating of  Cx43 by pp60<sup>v-src</sup></title><p>Phosphorylation of Cx43 on tyrosines in response to  pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> has been correlated with the loss of junctional  coupling in several mammalian cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Crow et al.,  1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Filson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Goldberg and Lau, 1993</xref>). This is  consistent with the more direct approach used in <italic>Xenopus</italic>  oocytes, where a mutation of Tyr265 eliminated closure of  Cx43 channels by v<italic>-src</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Swenson et al., 1990</xref>). However,  the implication of at least two sites in v<italic>-src</italic> gating of Cx43  from the above truncation and deletion studies raised  questions about ascribing all effects of v<italic>-src</italic> to a single tyrosine, although a second potential site of v<italic>-src</italic> phosphorylation (Tyr247) has subsequently been identified  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Kurata and Lau, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Lau et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>To our surprise, we found that mutants Cx43 Y265F and  Cx43 Y247F were inhibited by v<italic>-src</italic> to the same extent as  wild-type Cx43 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Even a double mutant of both tyrosines (Y265/247F) had a similar lack of effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>),  while Y265F and Y265/247F tyrosine mutants with HA tag  at the carboxy end generate functional channels with no  detectable difference from wild-type Cx43. These results  might seem irreconcilable with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Swenson et al.  (1990)</xref>. However, in the current experiments we intentionally focused on the acute effects of expressing pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup>  after gap junction channels had stably formed, so as to  examine predominantly gating events on established channels. This differs from the previous study where v<italic>-src</italic> and  connexins were expressed together, thereby introducing  potentially complicating effects on biosynthesis. In a parallel experiment, we attempted to reproduce these conditions by coinjecting cRNAs for v<italic>-src</italic> and Cx43 or Cx43  Y265F, and recording conductances after 18 h of incubation at 18&#x000b0;C. In this scenario, the Y265F mutant does show  a reduced response to v<italic>-src</italic> (about a fivefold decrease)  compared with Cx43 wild-type (&#x0223c;200-fold decrease; Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), although the loss of responsiveness is still less than  that reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Swenson et al., 1990</xref>). Together,  these results indicate that the known sites of v<italic>-src</italic> phosphorylation on Cx43 (i.e., Y265 and Y247) are not essential for closure of the channels by this oncogene, although  they do appear to play some as yet undefined inhibitory  role in biosynthesis of the functional channels.</p></sec><sec><title>Putative MAP Kinase Sites Are Implicated in Cx43  Gating by pp60<sup>v-src</sup></title><p>In the absence of evidence relating direct phosphorylation  of Cx43 on tyrosines to channel gating by v<italic>-src</italic>, we turned  to an analysis of other sites on Cx43 that could be involved  less directly. Both proline rich sequences, <sup>253</sup>PLSP<sup>256</sup> and  <sup>277</sup>PLSPMSP<sup>283</sup>, lying within the deleted region we have  defined as essential for v<italic>-src</italic>'s action on Cx43 gap junctions, contain potential SH3 binding domains (PxxP) and  putative MAP kinase sites (S255, S279, and S282; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).  Two mutagenic strategies were employed in an effort to  dissect the relevant functions of these domains. Mutation  of prolines in these sites should compromise their function  as SH3 binding domains. However, it is also likely to impair their efficiency as targets of MAP kinase, as the prolines form a critical part of the recognition motif for this  enzyme. Alternatively, mutation of relevant serines in  these sites to alanines should directly eliminate them as  targets of MAP kinase. This should have little effect on the  proposed role of these regions as SH3 binding elements,  based on known characteristics of consensus SH3 binding  sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Lim and Richards, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">Yu et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, one  would predict that if the importance of these domains in  v<italic>-src</italic> gating of Cx43 is as a target of MAP kinase, both  proline and serine mutations should be equally effective. If  SH3 binding is a more relevant property, proline mutants  should have a much greater effect on v<italic>-src</italic> induced gating  than serine mutants. Consistent with the former hypothesis, we found that double mutants of either prolines (i.e.,  P253/256A and P277/280A) or serines (i.e., S255/257A and  S279/282A) in either site showed identical refractoriness  to inhibition by v<italic>-src</italic>. A mutant combining serine mutations in both sites (S255/257/279/282A) showed an even  greater loss of responsiveness to v<italic>-src</italic>, compared with mutations within a single site (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 in either case). At an  &#x003b1; &#x0003d; 0.01 level of significance, this quadruple serine mutant  of Cx43 showed a response to v<italic>-src</italic> indistinguishable from  Cx32 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), a connexin containing no consensus sites  for v<italic>-src</italic> or MAP kinase phosphorylation. These results  strongly suggest that activation of MAP kinase, or a related kinase with a similar recognition motif, is required  for the gating effect of v<italic>-src</italic> on Cx43.</p></sec><sec><title>pp60<sup>v-src</sup> Associates to Variable Extents with Cx43 and  its Mutants</title><p>Recent reports have linked the specific binding of v<italic>-src</italic> to  Cx43, by way of both its SH3 and SH2 domains, to the efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of connexin, although the  functional consequences for channel function were not assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Kanemitsu et al., 1997</xref>). However, the implication  of serine kinase sites in the gating of Cx43 by v<italic>-src</italic>, rather  than tyrosine phosphorylation or SH3 binding, leads to the  prediction that v<italic>-src</italic> binding to Cx43 should not have a  dominant role in its gating response. This was directly  tested by examining the association between pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> and  wild-type and mutant forms of Cx43.</p><p>To document the same association between Cx43 and  pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> as seen in mammalian cells, <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes  were injected with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine and Cx43 cRNA, with  or without pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> cRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A). In the absence of  pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup>, immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Cx43  (directed to residues 302&#x02013;319) yield a major band on SDS-PAGE of 43 kD, corresponding to the mobility of nonphosphorylated Cx43 as seen in rat brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Kadle et al.,  1991</xref>), and variable amounts of a lower band of &#x0223c;41 kD  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A, lane 2). This 41-kD band appeared to be a degradation product of the major 43-kD band rather than a  phosphorylated variant, as demonstrated by alkaline phosphatase treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Upon  coexpression of pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup>, a second band of 60 kD was also  precipitated by this antibody, but only in the presence of  Cx43 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A, compare lanes 2 and 3). This band comigrates with the pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> precipitated by an anti-<italic>src</italic> mAb  from oocytes injected only with pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> cRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A,  lane 6). It was also independently recognized in these  Cx43 immunoprecipitates on Western blots probed with  v<italic>-src</italic> antibody (data not shown). Coexpression of v<italic>-src</italic> and  Cx43 also resulted in the appearance of minor bands of  slightly slower mobility than the major 43-kD band (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>  A, lane 3) that have been previously associated with serine  phosphorylated forms of Cx43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Filson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Kurata  and Lau, 1994</xref>).

The increase  in intensity of the 41-kD proteolytic product after alkaline  phosphatase treatment suggests that this truncated form of  Cx43 is also phosphorylated. </p><p>The 60-kD v<italic>-src</italic> oncogene was also found to coprecipitate with the COOH-terminal peptide of Cx43 when coexpressed in oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A, lane 4), indicating that this  domain mediates the interaction of Cx43 and pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup>. As  was the case for the full-length connexin, coexpression  with pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> also induced the appearance of a second,  slower mobility form of the COOH-terminal peptide (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A, lane 4; B, compare lanes 5 and 7) that likely corresponds to a phosphorylated form (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> B, compare lanes  7 and 8).</p><p>Each of the mutant constructs tested above was also  precipitated from oocytes in the absence (&#x02212;) or presence  (&#x0002b;) of coexpressed pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> to assess their potential binding capacity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In all mutants, pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> coprecipitated with Cx43, but in some cases to a much lesser extent.  This was quantitated by normalizing the ratio of labeled  60-kD product and labeled mutant Cx43 (in its phosphorylated and partially truncated forms) to that seen with wild-type Cx43 in the same oocyte batch. These results, presented as percentages, are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>. Only three  mutants showed a dramatic loss of v<italic>-src</italic> binding: both deletions involving the second putative SH3 binding site  (Cx43 &#x00394;261&#x02013;280 and Cx43 &#x00394;241&#x02013;280); and, to a lesser degree, the double tyrosine mutation Cx43 Y247/265F. Minor reductions in v<italic>-src</italic> binding were also detected in each  of the single tyrosine mutants, and to a lesser degree in the  two double proline mutants. No significant reduction in  v<italic>-src</italic> binding was seen in deletions of the first putative  SH3 binding domain (i.e., Cx43 &#x00394;241&#x02013;260) nor in the various point mutations of serines. Consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Kanemitsu et al.

However, the Cx43 Y265/247F mutant  shows markedly reduced binding of pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> compared  with wild-type, but nonetheless closes in response to v<italic>-src</italic>  indistinguishably from wild-type. In contrast, each of the  paired site mutants of serines, as well as the &#x00394;241&#x02013;260 deletion, show significantly reduced gating in response to  v<italic>-src</italic>, but no detectable decrease in v<italic>-src</italic> binding. This  comparison supports the initial prediction, based on a  mechanism mainly involving a mitogen-activated or related kinase, that binding of v<italic>-src</italic> to Cx43 does not play a  major role in direct gating of Cx43 channels.</p></sec><sec><title>Blockage of MAP Kinase Activation in LA25 Cells  Prevents v-src Induced Cell Uncoupling</title><p>We attempted to directly address the role of MAP kinase  as an effector of v<italic>-src</italic> mediated closure of Cx43 channels  by inhibition of MAP kinase in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, using either antisense oligonucleotides against the ERK2 isotype  of MAP kinase, or the MEK inhibitor PD98059. Although  inhibitory effects on MAP kinase correlate with reduced  ability of v<italic>-src</italic> to close Cx43 gap junction channels, full inhibition of MAP kinase could not be achieved with either  approach in oocytes. Hence, we turned to better characterized mammalian cell lines, specifically NRK cells expressing a temperature-sensitive variant of v<italic>-src</italic> (LA25  cells), Cx43, and in some cases, exogenously introduced  Cx32.</p><p>Communication through gap junction in these LA25  cells, as measured by dye coupling, is quickly disrupted  upon v<italic>-src</italic> activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Atkinson et al., 1981</xref>; also see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>  A, left column). Consistently, we found cell coupling levels  decreased as early as 5 min, and dropped dramatically to  5% of original levels within 30 min of switching to the permissive temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> B). Treatment of cells with the  PD98059 inhibitor of MEK, before and throughout the  shift to permissive temperature for v<italic>-src</italic> activity, allowed  the cells to remain coupled (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> A, right column). Some  reduction in coupling in response to v<italic>-src</italic> activation (up to  &#x0223c;55% of original levels) was evident, even in the presence  of inhibitor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> B). As with oocyte studies, we employed cells expressing Cx32 (isolated as a stably transfected clone of LA25 cells designated O25 as a control  for effects of v<italic>-src</italic> not specific to connexins. This clone  showed only a modest reduction in coupling (up to &#x0223c;75%  of original levels) in response to v<italic>-src</italic> activation that  proved insensitive to application of the MEK inhibitor.  This is comparable to results with Cx32 expressing oocytes, and indicates much of the drop in coupling seen in  LA25 cells in the presence of MEK inhibitor is attributable to effects of v<italic>-src</italic> not specific for gap junctions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Inhibition of intercellular communication through gap  junction channels has long been linked to enhanced cell division and growth in both normal and transformed cells.

This phosphorylation of  Cx43 apparently requires direct association of Cx43 with  pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Kanemitsu et al., 1997</xref>). Here we have used the  <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte expression system to further investigate  the molecular mechanism by which pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> causes closure  of Cx43 channels.</p><p>Our results implicate a ball and chain model in this gating process, in that an independently expressed COOH-tail peptide restores the sensitivity to v<italic>-src</italic> of a COOH-terminally truncated form of Cx43. In the originally  proposed ball and chain model of K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel inactivation  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Hoshi et al., 1990</xref>), gating is mediated by interactions between the channel pore and the gating domain. In the case  of Cx43, the COOH-terminal tail serves as the gating particle, with the interaction triggered by v<italic>-src</italic> expression. To  investigate the nature of this triggering, we employed systematic truncation and deletion mutagenesis of the Cx43  COOH-terminal domain. This implicated two regions  (241&#x02013;260 and 261&#x02013;280), each containing potential sites for  tyrosine and serine (e.g., MAP kinase) phosphorylation, as  well as SH3 binding motifs. These regions appeared to act  cooperatively to fully account for v<italic>-src</italic> gating of Cx43.  While a similar ball and chain mechanism has been proposed to be triggered by reduced cytoplasmic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Liu et al.,  1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Morley et al., 1996</xref>), the COOH-terminal sequences  that are required are somewhat different from this study  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Ek-Vitorin et al., 1996</xref>), and include residues 374&#x02013;382, as  well as an overlapping domain from 261&#x02013;300. Thus, it is  likely that pH and v<italic>-src</italic> induced gating utilize different  downstream factors requiring distinct structural elements  on the COOH-terminal peptide. Recently, an insulin-stimulated decrease in Cx43 mediated coupling was also shown  to occur through a ball and chain mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Homma et  al., 1998</xref>). In this case, one of the two domains implicated  here (261&#x02013;280) was found to play a role, although no indication of involvement of residues 241&#x02013;260 was evident, indicating some differences in this case, too.</p><p>Whether different receptors for the ball are needed remains to be determined. However, in the case of v<italic>-src</italic>, this  study does demonstrate this receptor is specific for Cx43,  since the addition of the Cx43 COOH-tail cRNA together  with v<italic>-src</italic> cRNA did not induce any change of conductance in Cx32 channels. At this point, we can not determine whether the COOH-terminal tail simply occludes the  channel, or induces a subsequent conformational change  upon interaction with other cytoplasmic domains of Cx43.</p><p>Using site-directed mutagenesis to further define targets  of v<italic>-src</italic> action within the two identified domains, we were  surprised to see no significant change in the response of  Cx43 to v<italic>-src</italic> when Tyr265 was changed to phenylalanine.  This residue has been identified in several studies as the  likely substrate for v<italic>-src</italic> on Cx43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Swenson et al., 1990</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Kanemitsu et al., 1997</xref>). Mutation of a second potential  v<italic>-src</italic> target, Tyr247 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Lau et al., 1996</xref>), alone, or in combination with Tyr265, also failed to decrease v<italic>-src</italic> gating of  Cx43. The disparity between our data and the results of  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Swenson et al. (1990)</xref>, who had shown a loss of v<italic>-src</italic> induced gating with the same Y265F mutant, may have resulted in part from differences in experimental design.</p><p>We have focused on the response of preformed gap  junction channels by injecting connexin cRNAs into oocytes and allowing formation of stable gap junction conductances before introduction of v<italic>-src</italic> cRNA. To allow for  efficient translation of v<italic>-src</italic>, we measured its effects on  Cx43 coupling after 6 h (although similar results were  found as soon as 3 h after <italic>src</italic> injection). Although we  record a &#x0003e;200-fold reduction of coupling, given the short  half life of Cx43 in other systems, it is possible turnover of  the protein could play a role. However, we have directly  measured Cx43 turnover in oocytes and found it to be &#x0223c;22 h,  presumably a reflection of the lower temperature (&#x0223c;19&#x000b0;C)  of this system, and possibly reflecting the semidormant  state of these cells. Thus, turnover of Cx43 contributed  negligibly to the reduction in coupling we observed. In  contrast, previous studies injected v<italic>-src</italic> and connexin  cRNAs at the same time, and therefore effects of v<italic>-src</italic> on  other phenomena, such as gap-junctional biosynthesis,  could have been included during the 24 h incubation  employed. Although actions of other kinases have been  linked to various stages of Cx43 biosynthesis (Musil et al.,  1991; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Oh et al., 1991</xref>), activation of temperature-sensitive  v<italic>-src</italic> in mammalian cells appears to have no obvious effect  on the distribution of gap junction plaques on the plasma  membrane (data not shown). However, this does not preclude more subtle changes that could render the docking interface of connexons nonfunctional. There is already precedent that cytoplasmic domains of connexins  can modify extracellular docking events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Haubrich et al.,  1996</xref>).</p><p>By recreating the conditions of the earlier study (i.e.,  coinjection of v<italic>-src</italic> and connexin cRNAs), we do find a  significant reduction in the effect of v<italic>-src</italic> on coupling mediated by Cx43 Y265F (&#x0223c;6-fold inhibition) compared with  wild-type Cx43 (&#x0003e;200-fold inhibition; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). While this  reduced response is less than that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Swenson et al.  (1990)</xref>, where Cx43 Y265F showed less than twofold reduction in conductance in response to v<italic>-src</italic>, such minor  differences could arise from variations in <italic>Xenopus</italic> strains  or the pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> variant. Our results support the contention  that direct phosphorylation of Cx43 by pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> can inhibit  coupling, but this appears to affect some earlier point in  channel assembly and can not account for the acute uncoupling of cells in response to v<italic>-src</italic> expression. Such  acute gating of Cx43 channels, characterized by a rapid decrease in P<sub>o</sub> (Moreno, A.P., and B.J. Nicholson, manuscript in preparation), appears to be induced indirectly  through MAP kinase. Neither in this nor previous studies,  have all possible tyrosine targets in Cx43 been systematically eliminated. However, we have tested all tyrosines  that have been identified as substrates of v<italic>-src</italic> in vivo  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Swenson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Kanemitsu et al., 1997</xref>), in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Lau  et al., 1996</xref>), and that lie within the 241&#x02013;280 residue domain identified as essential for v<italic>-src</italic> gating of Cx43. None  play a role in acute channel closure.</p><p>Recent studies indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of  Cx43 requires binding to v<italic>-src</italic>, through an interaction that  is dependent on both Tyr265 and the proline-rich region  from amino acids 271&#x02013;287, that appear to serve as targets  of SH2 and SH3 domains of v<italic>-src</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Kanemitsu  et al., 1997</xref>). We have also demonstrated an association between v<italic>-src</italic> and the COOH-terminal domain of Cx43 in  the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte system dependent on the same sites.  However, the ability of v<italic>-src</italic> to bind Cx43 did not correlate with its functional effects on Cx43, a comparison that  was not made in prior studies. Some mutants that showed  markedly reduced pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> binding were still sensitive to  the oncogene (e.g., Cx43 Y265/247F), while others that  bound v<italic>-src</italic> indistinguishably from wild-type Cx43 (such  as Cx43 &#x00394;241&#x02013;260, Cx43 S255/257A and Cx43 S279/282A),  had markedly reduced gating responses to v<italic>-src</italic>. This further reinforces the contention that direct interaction of  v<italic>-src</italic> with Cx43 may modulate coupling and tyrosine phosphorylation of Cx43, but not through channel gating.</p><p>If direct phosphorylation of Tyr265/247 by v<italic>-src</italic> or its  binding with Cx43, is not critical to the gating of Cx43  channels, then what is the mechanism? One possible alternative is serine phosphorylation of Cx43 by other kinases  that are activated by v<italic>-src</italic>. In several studies examining effects of v<italic>-src</italic>, Cx43 demonstrated increased levels of phosphoserines in addition to phosphotyrosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Filson et al.,  1990</xref>; Kurata et al., 1994). Deletion mutants that showed  reduced response to v<italic>-src</italic> contain documented MAP kinase phosphorylation sites (S255, S279, and S282) embedded in the MAP kinase recognition motif, PXSP. Pairwise  point mutations of these serines (S255/257 and S279/282),  and the surrounding prolines defining the MAP kinase  consensus site (P253/256 and P277/280), support the involvement of this kinase, or one with a closely related target site, in the v<italic>-src</italic> induced gating of Cx43. It appears  phosphorylation at more than one site is required, as a  quadruple serine mutant reflected a cumulative effect of  the two double serine mutants. Some of these mutants,  specifically the prolines, are also likely to have compromised the role of these regions as SH3 binding sites. However, as noted above, the effectiveness of various mutants  in eliminating v<italic>-src</italic> gating of Cx43, and compromising  v<italic>-src</italic> binding to Cx43, are not closely correlated. The most  direct case for the requirement for MAP kinase in the gating response of Cx43 to v<italic>-src</italic>, however, is provided by our  studies of acute uncoupling of LA25 cells on activation of  v<italic>-src</italic>. Here, a blocker of MEK (and hence MAP kinase activation) eliminated much of v<italic>-src</italic> induced uncoupling.</p><p>As in our oocyte studies, Cx32 expressing cells were  used as a control for the effects of v<italic>-src</italic> not specific to connexins. The cells showed &#x0223c;25% reduction in coupling insensitive to application of MEK inhibitor. It is likely this  reduction in Cx32 mediated coupling, seen in oocytes and  NRK cells, results from the well-documented inhibitory  effects of v<italic>-src</italic> on cell adhesion. This is believed to occur  through disruption of the cadherin&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin interaction  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Matsuyoshi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Hamaguchi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Behrens  et al., 1993</xref>) by a mechanism that does not depend on  MAP kinase. Given the established relationship between  cadherin expression and efficient gap junction formation  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Keane et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Musil et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Jongen et al., 1991</xref>),  the small but consistent loss of coupling between Cx32  coupled cells and oocytes is not surprising, despite the lack  of potential v<italic>-src</italic> or MAP kinase targets or binding domains on Cx32 itself.</p><p>All manipulations employed that would be expected to  eliminate MAP kinase effects on Cx43 (i.e., &#x00394;245, &#x00394;241&#x02013; 280, S255/257/279/282A in oocytes, and use of a MEK inhibitor in LA25 cells) served to largely prevent <italic>src</italic>-induced  uncoupling. However, we consistently observed a residual  uncoupling effect beyond that seen in Cx32 negative controls. This suggests that, although MAP kinase may be  necessary for v<italic>-src</italic> induced gating of Cx43, other factors  may also influence coupling. Of note is a recent report implicating c-<italic>src</italic>, rather than MAP kinase, in acute loss of  gap junction communication in Rat-1 fibroblast cells in  response to G-protein receptor agonists such as LPA  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Postma et al., 1998</xref>). Previous studies have not shown direct effects of c-<italic>src</italic> on cell coupling, but it is possible, in  some systems, that c-<italic>src</italic> may work through effectors different from that activated by v<italic>-src</italic>.</p><p>The compilation of results presented suggest that MAP  kinase, or a related kinase, is necessary for v<italic>-src</italic> induced  Cx43 gating. This is consistent with established mitogenic  pathways of pp60<sup>v<italic>-src</italic></sup> which associates, and phosphorylates, with the adaptor protein Shc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">Rozakis-Adcock et al.,  1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Pelicci et al., 1992</xref>) that in turn activates Ras/Raf,  leading to activation of MAP kinase. This potentially establishes a common element to the regulation of gap junctions during mitogenesis. EGF and PDGF also acutely  suppress gap-junctional communication in Cx43 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Maldonado et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Lau et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Oh et al.,  1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Mensink et al., 1996</xref>). Although activation of c-<italic>src</italic> by  EGF receptor is central to many of its enhanced mitogenic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Luttrell et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">Wilson et al., 1989</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Twamley-Stein et al., 1993</xref>), reduction of Cx43 coupling  was correlated with serine, not tyrosine phosphorylation.  In this case, too, MAP kinase was the prime suspect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Lau  et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Kanemitsu and Lau, 1993</xref>). Therefore, we propose that MAP kinase may act as a common downstream  effector of uncoupling for both tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors and the v<italic>-src</italic> oncogene. The study presented  here also indicates that this gating is not mediated by a  propagated conformational change, but by interactions between discrete domains of Cx43 (i.e., ball and chain mechanism), apparently triggered by a serine phosphorylation  event. This potentially represents a common mechanism  linking the uncoupling of cells to mitogenesis.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Tyr265 and Tyr247 are not required for v<italic>-src</italic> induced  gating of Cx43 channels.
