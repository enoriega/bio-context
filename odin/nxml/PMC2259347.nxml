After the components of the death-inducing signaling complex of the related death receptor CD95 (APO-1/Fas) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] were identified, it was widely assumed that TNFR1 also recruits both the FADD adaptor and caspase 8 upon binding of its ligand, TNF-&#x003b1;, resulting in the subsequent initiation of apoptosis. However, all attempts to demonstrate a direct physical association of FADD and caspase 8 with TNFR1 have so far been unsuccessful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], whereas the anti-apoptotic components of the signaling complex containing TNF-&#x003b1; receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD) and c-IAP1 are readily detectable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to our understanding of the FAS and TRAIL receptors, the molecular mechanisms underlying TNFR1-induced cell death remain poorly defined, despite extensive study of the signaling pathways that operate through this receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It is currently believed that the engagement of TNFR1 triggers the recruitment of the DD-containing adaptor molecule, TRADD, followed by the DD-containing Ser/Thr kinase RIP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This signaling complex is required for TRAF2/5 and c-IAP1 binding, which leads to triggering of the NF-&#x003ba;B and JNK signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. TNFR1 binding by its ligand triggers these pathways, and can induce apoptosis by alternately binding the DD-containing adaptor FADD (through TRADD), which facilitates caspase 8 recruitment and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The activation of the TNFR1 death receptor by TNF-&#x003b1; leads to the recruitment of TRADD, which serves as a platform for the formation of various signaling complexes involved in different biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. For instance, TRADD can recruit FADD and promote caspase-8 activation and apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, TNF-&#x003b1; is not cytotoxic to most cells because TRADD can also recruit TRAF2 and RIP to form distinct complexes leading to the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Because activation of NF-&#x003ba;B serves as a primary mechanism to protect cells against apoptotic stimuli such as TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], TNF-&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis requires NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition.</p><p>The involvement of JNK in TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated apoptosis is highly controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Induction of NF-&#x003ba;B has been shown recently to inhibit TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated JNK activation. Moreover, blocking NF-&#x003ba;B results in the sustained activation of JNK, which may directly promote TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, although sustained activation of JNK promotes cell death, the molecular basis of how this contributes to TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated apoptosis remains to be addressed.</p><p>One of the well described apoptosis inhibitors is c-FLIP, which is also known as FLAME-1/I-FLICE/CASPER/CASH/MRIT/CLARP/Usurpin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. c-FLIP<sub>L </sub>and c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>contain two DED domains that are structurally similar to the N-terminal part of procaspase-8. The C terminus of c-FLIP<sub>L </sub>consists of two catalytically inactive caspase-like domains (p20 and p12), whereas the short C terminus of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>shows no homology to procaspases-8 or -10. Both isoforms of c-FLIP are recruited to the DISC by DED-DED interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, it remains to be clarified in detail whether the differences in the mechanism of apoptosis inhibition also reflect different functional roles of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>and c-FLIP<sub>L </sub>and by which downstream mechanisms they are mediated.</p><p>Genetic evidence suggests that FADD and caspase 8 are important for TNFR1-mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, expression of the inhibitor of caspase 8, c-FLIP<sub>L</sub>, inhibits the TNF-&#x003b1;-induced apoptotic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], which provides further evidence for the important role of caspase 8 in this cascade. Expression of c-FLIP<sub>L </sub>is induced by NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], which may explain why death receptor-induced apoptosis is generally blocked in cells with active NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p>Here we examined whether c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>effectively inhibits TNFR1-mediated apoptosis and triggers JNK activation through its interaction with TRAF2. The effects of TRAF2 in TNFR1-mediated apoptosis was attenuated by DN-TRAF2, and the level of p-JNK in c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>siRNA increased more in TNF-&#x003b1; sensitive cell line than in a TNF-&#x003b1; resistant cell line. In this paper, we demonstrate that the regulation of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>is related to the TNFR1 signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Inhibition of TNFR1-mediated apoptosis is dependent on the expression levels of c-FLIP<sub>S</sub></title><p>To examine the relationship between the expression level of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>and the apoptotic response, we used real-time PCR to examine the expression of c-FLIP in human cancer cell lines. We have shown previously that c-FLIP<sub>L </sub>is a more potent inhibitor than c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>of Fas ligand-induced apoptosis and that c-FLIP<sub>L </sub>physically binds to Daxx through an interaction between its C-terminal domain and the Fas-binding domain of Daxx, an alternative Fas-signaling adaptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Interestingly, some cancer cell lines, such as DU145, AGS, and PC3, have higher levels of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>than other cell lines, such as SNU-719 and T24 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). However, the expression of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>at the transcriptional level does not exactly reflect the protein levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This discrepancy may result from the low mRNA stability of c-FLIP, which has been described recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The expression levels of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>indicate a relationship to resistance to TNF-induced apoptosis</bold>.

We investigated the role of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>in this pathway by transfecting into SNU-719 cells, which express a lower level of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>than other cell lines, because we did not have a knockout cell line of c-FLIP<sub>S</sub>. Although the ectopic expression of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>and c-FLIP<sub>L </sub>did not significantly inhibit TNF-&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis, the inhibition of TNFR1-induced apoptosis by c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>was more potent than that of c-FLIP<sub>L </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>confers stronger resistance to TNF-&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis than c-FLIP<sub>L</sub>, through a TRAF2-dependent mechanism</bold>.

(E) To confirm the results, we examined caspase 3 activity in the same conditions as described in Fig.2.

We found other significant differences in the effects of these c-FLIP variants on the TNF-&#x003b1;-induced activation of JNK. In c-FLIP<sub>L</sub>-transfected cells, TNF induced the phosphorylation of JNK, whereas in c-FLIP<sub>S</sub>-expressing cells, the phosphorylation of JNK was not changed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). To address the role of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>in the activation of JNK, we examined the molecular interaction between c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>and TRAF2, a mediator of TNF-induced JNK and NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Extracts from cell lines expressing pcDNA, c-FLIP<sub>L</sub>, and c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>were immunoprecipitated with TRAF2 or with the corresponding preimmune serum. As expected, western blot analysis revealed that TRAF2 antibody immunoprecipitated a greater amount of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>than c-FLIP<sub>L </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). To verify whether TRAF2 mediates TNFR1-induced apoptosis, DN-TRAF2 was transiently expressed using the same conditions as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). The effects on TNF-&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis did not differ between the c-FLIP variants. To measure the activity of apoptosis, we also examined the level of caspase 3 by immunoblotting after treatment with DN-TRAF2. As expected, the level of caspase 3 protein did not differ between the three c-FLIP variants (procaspase data not shown) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). These results suggest that each c-FLIP variant is capable of binding to TRAF2, where it may inhibit TNFR1-mediated apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>The function of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>is exerted through TNFR1-mediated JNK activation</title><p>The TNFR1-mediated apoptotic response has two pathways: type 1 apoptosis achieved through FADD-caspase 8 activation, and type 2 mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, which is less-dependent on the FADD-caspase 8 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. TNF-&#x003b1; enhances the activity of JNK, which leads to dysfunctional mitochondria and contributes to TNF-&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

Treatment with TNF-&#x003b1; increased the phosphorylated JNK level in SNU719 and T24 cells, whereas DU145 and AGS cells were resistant to TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).

To select a potent candidate siRNA oligonucleotide, we transfected human PC3 cells, which express a higher level of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>than other cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), with siRNAs. Cells were incubated for 48 h, and the level of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>proteins was assessed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The results confirmed the ability of oligonucleotides C2 and C3 to knock down expression of c-FLIP<sub>S</sub>. To verify the effect of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>knockdown on JNK activation, we studied several cancer cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Phosphorylated JNK levels increased in T24 and SNU719 cells, whereas AGS and DU145 cells were resistant to TNF-&#x003b1;. We also examined the susceptibility of these cell lines to TNF-&#x003b1; in c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>siRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The basal level of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>was marginal in T24 and SNU719 cells, but DU145 and AGS cell lines expressed some degree of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>protein in the control condition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Relative to the basal level of c-FLIP<sub>S</sub>, the ratio of apoptosis increased more in DU145 (7 fold) and AGS cells (6 fold) than in T24 cells (2.5 fold), although these differences were not considerable. Apoptosis analysis indicated that knockdown of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>in SNU719 and T24 cells increased the level of spontaneous cell death by about 40% compared with control, whereas knockdown of DU145 and AGS had minimal effects. To confirm this result, we used immunoblot analysis to examine the level of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>protein in these cell lines after treatment with siRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).

Our current data provide insight into the mechanism underlying the TNF-&#x003b1;-induced apoptotic pathway. This pathway is characterized by a higher affinity of TRAF2 for c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>over c-FLIP<sub>L </sub>and involves suppression of JNK activation and resistance to TNF-&#x003b1;-induced cell death. c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>is also readily detectable in various types of human cancer and confers resistance to CD95-mediated apoptosis in T cells during the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Our results are summarized in the model shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. It appears that c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>and c-FLIP<sub>L </sub>have distinct roles, and we speculate that c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>acts primarily to support TNF-induced JNK activation. Our results are consistent with previous data showing different functions of each type of c-FLIP, including a specific role for c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>in CD40 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A distinct action of each c-FLIP variant in Fas-induced cleavage of caspase 8 has also been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. According to these earlier studies, c-FLIP<sub>L </sub>and c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>produce different end products in the caspase 8 pathway. Our data also show that apoptosis sensitivity correlates with c-FLIP expression in several cell types, including dendritic cells, keratinocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>A working model of the role of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>in TNFR1-mediated apoptosis</bold>.

However, the cellular c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>level is elevated sufficiently to block apoptosis and promote cell survival.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1750-2187-3-2-5"/></fig><p>Although TRAF2 bound both c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>and c-FLIP<sub>L </sub>in our experiments, other reports have shown that c-FLIP<sub>L </sub>interacts exclusively with TRAF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This discrepancy may be reconciled by recent studies showing that alternative variants of c-FLIP promote different TNF-&#x003b1;-induced signaling pathways. c-FLIP<sub>L </sub>has a strong affinity for Raf, whereas c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>is tightly associated with TRAF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The gene knockout and siRNA knockdown studies of c-FLIP reported to date show that reduction of both c-FLIP variants sensitizes cells to death receptor-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We used a selective siRNA knockdown approach to assess the specific function of endogenous c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>and compare this with the function of c-FLIP<sub>L</sub>. Our results reinforce the conclusion that endogenous c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>inhibits death receptor-mediated apoptosis.</p><p>Our data showing that c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>interacts rapidly with FADD and enhances the activation of JNK through TRAF2 may explain why c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>shows high expression levels, despite its overlapping role with c-FLIP<sub>L</sub>. In addition, the expression pattern of c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>is coupled to the expression of TNF. Our current experiments have confirmed our previous data showing that each type of c-FLIP has a distinct target in the inhibition of apoptosis. We postulate that the different expression patterns of the c-FLIP variants are specific to cancer cell type.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>Human cancer cell lines were obtained from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco BRL) heat inactivated at 37&#x000b0;C; cells were grown in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Except as indicated, all other chemicals used in this experiment were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Recombinant human TNF-&#x003b1; and antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotech.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of vectors and transfection procedure</title><p>Expression constructs for c-FLIP<sub>L</sub>, c-FLIP<sub>S</sub>, and a dominant-negative version of TRAF2 (TRAF2<sup>266&#x02013;501</sup>) were generated by RT-PCR-based cloning into the pcDNA 3.1 topo His/V5 vector (Invitrogen.) Geneporter transfection reagent was purchased from Gene Therapy Systems. The transfection procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded in six-well plates at a concentration of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well. Four micrograms of DNA per well was mixed with serum-free media containing Geneporter (10 &#x003bc;l/well), incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and added to cells that had previously been washed twice with PBS. After 3&#x02013;5 h, media (1 ml/well) containing 20% FBS was added to each well. All experiments, including thymidine-incorporation assays, western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and cell death assays, were performed after incubation for 24 h. To monitor transfection efficiency, cells were cotransfected with GFP-pcDNA.</p></sec><sec><title>siRNA preparation and transfection</title><p>Small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides against c-FLIP<sub>S </sub>were synthesized by BLOCK-iT&#x02122; RNAi Designer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] (C1: 5'GCCATTTGACCTGCTCAAA3' C2: 5'GCAGAGATTGGTGAGGATT3' C3: 5'GGAGAAACTAAATCTGGTT3'). All siRNA oligonucleotides were resuspended to a concentration of 20 &#x003bc;M. The cells were seeded for transfection in medium without antibiotics one day before transfection to ensure they were 85%&#x02013;95% confluent on the day of transfection. For transfection, regular medium was replaced with serum-free medium without antibiotics. The cells were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 1:3 siRNA:Lipofectamine (&#x003bc;g:&#x003bc;l), giving a final concentration of 100&#x02013;150 nM siRNA. The cells were incubated with the siRNA-Lipofectamine 2000 complex for 4 h, the serum-free medium was replaced with normal medium (containing 10% FBS) without antibiotics, and the cells incubated for a total of 48 h before further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time PCR</title><p>Reactions for real-time PCR were performed in a final volume of 25 &#x003bc;l using TaqMan detection.
