We demonstrate that this is accompanied by degradation of C/EBPbeta1. C/EBPbeta is a transcription factor in which three protein isoforms exist due to alternative translation at three in-frame methionines. When C/EBPbeta1 is expressed in MCF10A-Ras(V12) cells, immunoblot analysis reveals that C/EBPbeta1 is degraded in these cells. Treatment of the MCF10A-Ras(V12)-C/EBPbeta1 cells with the cdk inhibitor roscovitine leads to stabilization of C/EBPbeta1. It has been previously shown that cdk2 phosphorylates C/EBPbeta on Thr235.

Aberrant function of the Ras pathway is very common in breast cancers (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Malaney and Daly, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Dunn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Introduction of activated Ras(V12) into most immortalized cell lines, including the immortalized MCF10A human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) line, leads to transformation. However, when Ras(V12) is expressed in primary cells, these cells senesce instead of undergoing transformation. This oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) displayed by primary cells represents a tumor suppressive mechanism inherent in these cells. Research is ongoing to determine the proteins and pathways involved in Ras transformation and Ras-induced senescence. It is important to determine the different molecular players necessary for Ras transformation versus Ras-induced senescence, as these could be critical targets for cancer therapy.</p><p id="P4">C/EBPbeta, an essential downstream mediator of both Ras transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) and activated Ras/Raf (a downstream mediator of Ras signaling)-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Sebastian <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kuilman <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family of basic leucine-zipper transcription factors. Three protein isoforms of C/EBPbeta exist due to alternative translation initiation at three in-frame methionines. In humans, full-length C/EBPbeta1 begins at the first in-frame ATG and has an apparent molecular weight of 52kDa. C/EBPbeta2 begins at the second in-frame methionine, 23 amino acids downstream from the first and appears as a doublet on immunoblots at 45kDa and 48kDa. C/EBPbeta3 begins at the last in-frame ATG at amino acid 198 and has an apparent molecular weight of 20kDa. C/EBPbeta1 and C/EBPbeta2 both contain the C-terminal DNA binding/dimerization domain and an N-terminal transactivation domain, allowing them to function as transcriptional activators. C/EBPbeta3 lacks the N-terminal transactivation domain and thus represses transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Descombes and Schibler, 1991</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The C/EBPbeta knockout mouse demonstrated that C/EBPbeta is essential for proper development of the mammary gland. These mice display a dual phenotype: a defect in MEC proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Robinson <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Seagroves <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). The production of multiple isoforms of C/EBPbeta may explain how a single transcription factor can regulate both differentiation and proliferation. The functional differences between the transactivator isoforms of C/EBPbeta have not been studied in great detail. C/EBPbeta1 is oftentimes mistaken for the 48 kDa (top band) of the C/EBPbeta2 doublet on immunoblots largely because C/EBPbeta1 is not expressed in transformed cell lines (see below). Because of this difficulty in deciphering between C/EBPbeta1 and -2 and because both isoforms are transcriptional activators, many consider them to be functionally redundant. However, recent studies indicate C/EBPbeta1 and -2 both play unique and important roles. For example, C/EBPbeta1 but not C/EBPbeta2 cooperates with c-Myb to transactivate differentiation genes in myeloid cells via the ability of C/EBPbeta1, but not -2, to recruit the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Kowenz-Leutz and Leutz, 1999</xref>). Additionally, C/EBPbeta1 but not C/EBPbeta2 can be modified by the post-translational modification SUMO-2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Eaton and Sealy, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, a striking difference exists in the expression profiles of C/EBPbeta1 and -2 in normal versus tumorigenic HMECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Eaton <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Koslowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). C/EBPbeta1 is found in normal MECs from reduction mammoplasties, whereas C/EBPbeta2 is not. Moreover, a majority of human breast tumors express significant levels of C/EBPbeta2. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Eaton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). C/EBPbeta2 is expressed in breast cancer cell lines, while p52-C/EBPbeta1 is not. Further investigation indicated that these distinct expression profiles have functional significance. C/EBPbeta2, but not C/EBPbeta1, can transactivate cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Eaton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) and PLAC1 (Koslwski <italic>et al</italic>., 2009), two genes whose protein products are involved in proliferation and commonly upregulated in breast cancer. Furthermore, C/EBPbeta2, but not C/EBPbeta1, over-expression in MCF10A MECs transforms this cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bundy and Sealy, 2003</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that C/EBPbeta1 and -2 are functionally distinct in MECs, with C/EBPbeta1 playing a role in non-proliferating MECs and C/EBPbeta2 promoting proliferation and other transforming characteristics.</p><p id="P6">Since C/EBPbeta is an essential downstream mediator of Ras signaling, the production of multiple isoforms of C/EBPbeta may be a potential mechanism to explain the functional differences observed upon expression of Ras(V12). C/EBPbeta is crucial for both Ras transformation and Ras-induced senescence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. (2002)</xref> reported that v-Ha-ras transgenic mice deficient for C/EBPbeta had smaller and fewer skin tumors than v-Ha-ras mice that expressed C/EBPbeta. They also demonstrated that C/EBPbeta cooperates with Ras(V12) in transformation of NIH-3T3 cells. Recently, C/EBPbeta has been shown to be necessary for Ras-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Sebastian <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Additionally, activation of interleukin-6 (IL6) by C/EBPbeta is essential for activated Raf(E600)-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kuilman <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P7">C/EBPbeta is phosphorylated in response to Ras signaling, and this phosphorylation is oftentimes critical for the Ras-induced phenotype observed. A residue in C/EBPbeta that is frequently phosphorylated upon Ras(V12) introduction is threonine 235 (Thr235) in humans (Thr189 in rat, Thr188 in mouse). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Shuman <italic>et al</italic>. (2004)</xref> revealed that Ras(V12) expression in NIH-3T3s enhanced phosphorylation of Thr189 in C/EBPbeta by cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (cdk2). Additionally, this site in C/EBPbeta2 is necessary for the Ras-stimulated interaction of C/EBPbeta2 and serum response factor for transactivation of serum response element in NIH-3T3 cells and was shown to be phosphorylated by Erk-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hanlon <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>).</p><p id="P8">As mentioned earlier, transformed cell lines typically do not express p52-C/EBPbeta1. However, the immortal but non-transformed HMEC line, MCF10A, expresses all three C/EBPbeta isoforms. In the current study, we demonstrate that when Ras(V12) is introduced into MCF10As, transformation is accompanied by degradation of p52-C/EBPbeta1. Treatment of MCF10A-Ras cells forced to express C/EBPbeta1 with the cdk inhibitor roscovitine stabilizes p52-C/EBPbeta1. It has been previously shown that cdk2 phosphorylates C/EBPbeta on Thr235 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Shuman <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). We demonstrate that mutation of Thr235 to alanine in C/EBPbeta1 is sufficient to restore stability of p52-C/EBPbeta1 expression in MCF10A-Ras cells. Since we observed that Ras(V12) negatively regulates C/EBPbeta1 in immortalized MCF10As, a cell line that escapes senescence upon introduction of Ras(V12), and we know that Ras(V12) induces senescence in a C/EBPbeta-dependent manner in normal cells, we decided to examine whether C/EBPbeta1 was able to induce senescence. Induction of IL6 by C/EBPbeta is critical for activated Raf(E600)-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kuilman <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). When C/EBPbeta-1 and -2 are compared, only full length C/EBPbeta1 strongly upregulates IL6 when introduced into the normal human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs), WI-38. Additionally we show that C/EBPbeta1 is a more potent inducer of senescence in these cells. Our results indicate that C/EBPbeta1 is negatively regulated by Ras(V12) in immortalized MCF10As and this full length C/EBPbeta isoform is able to induce senescence in WI-38 cells by inducing IL6. Taken together, degradation of C/EBPbeta1 by Ras activation may represent a mechanism to bypass OIS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ras(V12) negatively regulates C/EBPbeta1 by causing degradation of C/EBPbeta1 in MCF10As</title><p id="P9">Expression of all three isoforms of C/EBPbeta is observed via immunoblot of cell lysates from MCF10As, an immortalized yet untransformed MEC line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, lane 1).

Infected cells were sorted by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker. Immediately after sorting, p52-T7-C/EBPbeta1 was expressed in both the MCF10A and MCF10A-Ras cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). However, T7-C/EBPbeta1 expression three weeks post-sorting is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1b and 1c</xref>. The MCF10A-C/EBPbeta1 cells still expressed p52-T7-C/EBPbeta1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>, lanes 1 and 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, lanes 1-7), but the MCF10A-Ras-C/EBPbeta1 cells largely lost p52-T7-C/EBPbeta1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>, lanes 2 and 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, lanes 8-14). A 31kDa band was observed in the MCF10A-Ras-C/EBPbeta1 cells in the anti-T7 tag immunoblot, indicative of proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>, Lane 2). This was confirmed by the presence of 31kDa and 23kDa bands in the anti-C-terminal C/EBPbeta immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>, Lane 3). These smaller molecular weight bands were not present in the MCF10A-C/EBPbeta1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>, Lanes 1 and 3).</p><p id="P11">To determine whether T7-C/EBPbeta1 is being proteolyzed by the proteasome in the MCF10A-Ras cells, we treated the cells with MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor. Treatment of MCF10A-Ras-C/EBPbeta1 cells with MG132 stabilized expression of p52-T7-CEBPbeta1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4 to 2). A similar effect was observed upon treatment with lactacystin, another proteasomal inhibitor (data not shown). Furthermore, treatment of MCF10A-Ras cells with MG132 stabilizes endogenous C/EBPbeta1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We then wanted to determine whether degradation of C/EBPbeta1 may be ubiquitin-mediated. MCF10A-Ras-C/EBPbeta1 cells were treated with MG132 and immunoprecipitated with T7-tag antibody beads. Immunoblot analysis with a Ubiquitin antibody demonstrated that MCF10A-Ras-C/EBPbeta1 cells treated with MG132 exhibit increased reactivity with this antibody compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref> lanes 5 versus lanes 3 and 4). Immunoblot analysis of the treated cells with the C/EBPbeta antibody demonstrates a ladder of higher molecular weight bands that coincide with the molecular weights of bands in the ubiquitin immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref> lanes 2 and 5, see arrows), indicating ubiquitination of C/EBPbeta1.</p><p id="P13">Most breast cancer cell lines exhibit activation of the Ras pathway through activation of upstream receptors, upregulation of Ras itself, or through activation of downstream signaling molecules (Melaney and Daly, 2001, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Dunn <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Therefore we expressed T7-C/EBPbeta1 in the breast cancer cell lines MDA231 and MDA435 in which the Ras pathway is activated. Expression of T7-C/EBPbeta1 in MDA231s and MDA435s decreases over time, similar to the MCF10A-Ras-C/EBPbeta1 cells, and p52-T7-C/EBPbeta1 was stabilized when MDA231-C/EBPbeta1 and MDA435-C/EBPbeta1 cells were exposed to MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, lane 3 versus 4, and data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Treatment with the cdk inhibitor roscovitine or mutation of C/EBPbeta1 Thr235 to alanine stabilizes expression of T7-C/EBPbeta1 in MCF10A-Ras cells</title><p id="P14">Ras(V12) expression in the MCF10A-Ras cells may lead to phosphorylation of C/EBPbeta1, which is subsequently causing degradation of C/EBPbeta1. To further investigate the mechanism by which Ras negatively regulates C/EBPbeta1, MCF10A-Ras-C/EBPbeta1 cells were treated with a panel of kinase inhibitors that inhibit kinases known to phosphorylate C/EBPbeta. Treatment with the cdk inhibitor roscovitine stabilized expression of p52-T7-C/EBPbeta1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 4). C/EBPbeta is phosphorylated on Thr235 by cdk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Shuman <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). More specifically, C/EBPbeta1 can be phosphorylated on Thr235 by cdk2 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This phosphorylation can be inhibited by treatment with roscovitine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Shuman <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, data not shown). Treatment with roscovitine was the only treatment that stabilized expression of p52-T7-C/EBPbeta1 in MCF10A-Ras cells. Treatment of MDA231-C/EBPbeta1 cells with roscovitine also stabilized expression of p52-T7-C/EBPbeta1 (data not shown). Importantly, cdk2 is activated in MCF10A-Ras and MDA231 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To confirm that phosphorylation by cdk2 on C/EBPbeta1-Thr235 was leading to degradation of C/EBPbeta1, Thr235 was mutated to alanine (T235A) so this residue could no longer be phosphorylated. An LZRS-T7-C/EBPbeta1T235A-IRES-eGFP retroviral vector was constructed and the resulting retrovirus used to infect MCF10A-Ras cells. These cells were sorted by FACS using GFP as a marker. Mutation of Thr235 to alanine in C/EBPbeta1, thus preventing phosphorylation of this residue by cdk2, stabilized the expression of p52-T7-C/EBPbeta1 after three weeks in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>, lane 3 versus 6) as compared to T7-C/EBPbeta1 that did not contain this mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>, lane 2 versus 5). T7-C/EBPbeta1 and T7-C/EBPbeta1T235A expression did not have an effect on the transformed phenotype of MCF10A-Ras cells, as these cells&#x02019; ability to form colonies in soft agar was unaltered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). T7-C/EBPbeta1 and T7-C/EBPbeta1T235A are unable to induce senescence in MCF10A cells in part because these cells have the p14ARF/p15INK4B/p16INK4A locus deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Iavarone and Massague, 1997</xref>). p16INK4A is an important player in OIS, and C/EBPbeta-induced senescence signals through this tumor suppressor during OIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Sebastian <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).

On average, over 53% of the T7-C/EBPbeta1-WI-38 cells and over 55% of the positive control Ras(V12)-WI-38 cells stained a bright blue, compared to 34.5% of the T7-C/EBPbeta2-expressing cells. Less than 20% of control uninfected or LZRS-GFP cells stained a faint blue. A statistically significant difference in blue staining exists between the T7-C/EBPbeta1- and Ras(V12)-expressing WI-38 cells versus uninfected, resulting in p values 0.005 and 0.003, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref>). This is consistent with T7-C/EBPbeta1-expressing cells inhibiting growth as shown earlier. Although the T7-C/EBPbeta2 cells induced senescence to a lesser extent than T7-C/EBPbeta1, the percentage of blue cells was still statistically significant as compared to uninfected cells, with a p value of 0.03. Approximately equal levels of T7-C/EBPbeta1 and T7-C/EBPbeta2 were expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>).</p><p id="P21">To confirm these findings, p16INK4A protein levels were examined, as p16INK4A is upregulated during senescence. WI-38 cells were uninfected, infected with LZRS-T7-C/EBPbeta1-IRES-eGFP, LZRS-T7-C/EBPbeta2-IRES-eGFP or LZRS-GFP, cell lysates were prepared 6 days post-infection and immunoblot analysis was performed for p16INK4A expression. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref> indicates that C/EBPbeta1 and C/EBPbeta2 expression in WI-38 cells induces p16INK2A expression, verifying the induction of senescence.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">Introduction of Ras(V12) into immortalized MCF10As transforms these cells. We demonstrate here that Ras(V12) introduction into MCF10As and subsequent transformation is accompanied by degradation of C/EBPbeta1. We show that when T7-C/EBPbeta1 is expressed in MCF10A and MCF10A-Ras cells, MCF10A-C/EBPbeta1 cells maintain expression of p52-T7-C/EBPbeta1, whereas MCF10A-Ras cells degrade p52-T7-C/EBPbeta1. Stability of C/EBPbeta1 expression may be regulated by ubiquitin-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). It has been previously demonstrated that p52-C/EBPbeta1 is expressed in normal mammary epithelial tissue and cultured normal MECs, but not in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Eaton <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). The Ras pathway is activated in most breast cancers. Expression of T7-C/EBPbeta1 in the breast cancer cell lines MDA231 and MDA435 decreased over time, similar to T7-C/EBPbeta1 expression in MCF10A-Ras cells. Additionally, treatment of MDA231- and MDA435-C/EBPbeta1 cells with a proteasomal inhibitor stabilized expression of p52-T7-C/EBPbeta1. Therefore it is likely that C/EBPbeta1 is negatively regulated in breast cancer through activation of the Ras pathway.</p><p id="P23">C/EBPbeta is phosphorylated by a number of kinases in the Ras pathway. Therefore we treated the MCF10A-Ras-C/EBPbeta1 cells with a panel of kinase inhibitors to determine if inhibiting phosphorylation could stabilize p52-C/EBPbeta1 expression. We found that treatment with the cdk inhibitor roscovitine stabilized C/EBPbeta1 expression. Ras activation activates cdk2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Musgrove, 2006</xref>). Two independent groups have demonstrated that C/EBPbeta can be phosphorylated on Thr235 by cdk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Shuman <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). This phosphorylation is specific to the cdk family member cdk2, and when cells are treated with roscovitine there is a decrease in phosphorylation of Thr235. Additionally, knockdown of cdk2 decreases phosphorylation of C/EBPbetaThr235 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The non-phosphorylatable C/EBPbeta1T235A could be stably expressed in MCF10A-Ras cells as compared to wild type C/EBPbeta1. Therefore, activation of the Ras pathway in MECs negatively regulates C/EBPbeta1 by promoting phosphorylation of C/EBPbeta1 on Thr235 by cdk2 and subsequently leading to degradation of C/EBPbeta1. Loss of T7-C/EBPbeta1 does take several days. This may be due to an initial compensatory mechanism by the cell leading to increased synthesis of C/EBPbeta1 and/or a requirement for expression of a specific ubiquitin E3 ligase necessary for the degradation of C/EBPbeta1.</p><p id="P24">Although introduction of Ras(V12) into many immortalized cell lines leads to transformation, introduction of Ras(V12) into primary cells has a different effect. Normal fibroblasts, such as WI-38 HDFs, undergo senescence when forced to express oncogenes such as activated Ras(V12) or Raf(E600). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Sebastian <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref> demonstrated that C/EBPbeta is necessary for Ras(V12)-induced senescence in MEFs, which occurred in a pRB-dependent manner. Recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kuilman <italic>et al</italic>. (2008)</xref> has shown that C/EBPbeta is required for activated Raf(E600)-induced senescence in HDFs. In the present study we set out to determine which transactivator isoform of C/EBPbeta is responsible for OIS, as there is increasing evidence for functional differences between the transactivator isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bundy <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Eaton <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Eaton and Sealy, 2003</xref>, Kowentz-Leutz and Leutz, 1999). First we demonstrate that C/EBPbeta1 is not degraded in senescing WI-38-Ras cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). This is because cdk2 is not activated in these cells due to activation of cdk inhibitors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kuilman <italic>et al</italic>. (2008)</xref> demonstrated that C/EBPbeta induced senescence through induction of IL6. We show that it is the full length isoform, C/EBPbeta1, that is able to robustly induce IL6 expression. Accordingly, we demonstrate that C/EBPbeta1 is the strongest inducer of senescence in WI-38 fibroblasts. C/EBPbeta2 can induce senescence to a lesser extent. It is interesting that C/EBPbeta2 expression in WI-38 fibroblasts does induce senescence. Because C/EBPbeta1 is expressed in the WI-38 cells, we cannot rule out that C/EBPbeta2 is heterodimerizing with the endogenous C/EBPbeta1 to induce IL6 and thus senescence, albeit at a lower level. Whether as a heterodimer or homodimer, C/EBPbeta2 may be upregulating the expression of other factors involved in OIS. Taken together, it is likely that Ras(V12)/Raf(E600) is working through C/EBPbeta1 to induce IL6 and lead to senescence in normal cells.</p><p id="P25">We propose that degradation of C/EBPbeta1 by Ras(V12) may be a mechanism by which cells bypass OIS. Loss of expression of full length C/EBPbeta1 may be necessary for escape from senescence and a step closer to transformation. Further support of this lies in the expression profile of C/EBPbeta1 in normal versus transformed cells. C/EBPbeta1 is present in normal cells, and is not degraded when Ras(V12) is introduced and induces senescence in normal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). Additionally, this first isoform of C/EBPbeta is negatively regulated by Ras during Ras(V12) transformation of MCF10As (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). p52-C/EBPbeta1 expression is not observed in breast cancer cells in which the Ras pathway is activated. The expression pattern of C/EBPbeta1 in normal versus transformed cells supports our current findings that C/EBPbeta1 plays an important role in senescence and is negatively regulated during transformation. It is not surprising that a protein that plays a critical role in OIS, a tumor suppressive mechanism, be down-regulated during transformation. Moreover, recently it has been shown that cdk2 suppresses cellular senescence, consistent with our findings that inhibiting cdk2 with roscovitine stabilizes expression of C/EBPbeta1, a factor involved in senescence (Campaner <italic>et al</italic>., Hydbring <italic>et al</italic>.). In further support of our findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kuilman <italic>et al</italic>. (2008)</xref> used a C/EBPbeta construct in which the start sites for C/EBPbeta2 and -3 were mutated such that only C/EBPbeta1 could be translated. They demonstrated that expression of this construct in HDFs led to cell cycle arrest and induction of IL6, consistent with our results.</p><p id="P26">The production of multiple isoforms of C/EBPbeta is a possible explanation for which this transcription factor could regulate the functional differences observed upon expression of Ras(V12). Our data indicate that C/EBPbeta1 is the isoform responsible for mediating Ras(V12)-induced senescence. In contrast to C/EBPbeta1, C/EBPbeta2 expression is not negatively regulated in MCF10A cells upon Ras(V12)-induced transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Additionally, overexpression of C/EBPbeta2 in MCF10As leads to the acquisition of tumorigenic characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bundy and Sealy, 2003</xref>), similarly to Ras(V12) expression in these cells. Therefore, Ras may be signaling to this second isoform of C/EBPbeta during transformation. Unfortunately it is not possible to knockdown each specific isoform of C/EBPbeta via siRNA technology and determine the role each isoform is playing, because all three isoforms are translated from a single mRNA molecule. Importantly, one study has examined the specific role of C/EBPbeta2 in activated macrophages by generating a knock-in mouse in which the second in-frame methionine necessary for translation of C/EBPbeta2 was replaced with an alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Uematsu <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). This abolished expression of C/EBPbeta2 in these mice. The induction of C/EBPbeta target genes, such as IL6, was examined in this study. Activated macrophages in the mice unable to express C/EBPbeta2 were still able to induce IL6 expression, consistent with our current findings that C/EBPbeta2 is not the primary isoform responsible for induction of IL6 in HDFs.</p><p id="P27">C/EBPbeta plays many functional roles in the cell, even roles that seem conflicting such as cell survival, cell death, proliferation, senescence, and transformation. This may be explained in part by the presence of the different isoforms of C/EBPbeta and their functional differences. Future studies on C/EBPbeta will need to take into consideration that the different isoforms of this transcription factor are likely playing functionally distinct roles. Degradation of C/EBPbeta1 by Ras(V12) may be a mechanism by which cells bypass OIS. Our study sheds light on how Ras signaling is altered in Ras(V12)-induced senescence versus transformation through the regulation of C/EBPbeta1, however further investigation of what dictates this transition is necessary to more completely understand this critical switch. It will be important to determine the details of the signaling between Ras and C/EBPbeta in normal cells to elucidate mechanisms by which this critical signaling that induces OIS can be triggered or maintained to suppress tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S10"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P28">HMECs, MCF10A, MDA231, and MDA435 were maintained as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bundy and Sealy, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Eaton <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>).

Equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane. Immunoblot analysis was carried out with an anti-p16INK4A antibody (Santa Cruz). Immunoblot analysis for beta-tubulin was performed as a loading control (Sigma T7816).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms-215755-f0006"/></fig></sec></back></article>
