We found that individual SAHFs originate from individual chromosomes. SAHFs do not show alterations of posttranslational modifications of core histones that mark condensed chromatin in mitotic chromosomes, apoptotic chromatin, or transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin. Remarkably, SAHF-positive senescent cells lose linker histone H1 and exhibit increased levels of chromatin-bound high mobility group A2 (HMGA2). The expression of N-terminally enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)&#x02013;tagged histone H1 induces premature senescence phenotypes, including increased levels of phosphorylated p53, p21, and hypophosphorylated Rb, and a decrease in the chromatin-bound endogenous histone H1 level but not in p16 level accumulation or SAHF formation. However, the simultaneous ectopic expression of hemagglutinin-tagged HMGA2 and N-terminally EGFP-tagged histone H1 leads to significant SAHF formation (P &#x0003c; 0.001). It is known that histone H1 and HMG proteins compete for a common binding site, the linker DNA. These results suggest that SAHFs are a novel type of chromatin condensation involving alterations in linker DNA&#x02013;binding proteins.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: AE, acid extracted; CENP-B, centromere protein B; HMG, high mobility group; ICD, interchromosome domain; IF, immunofluorescence; SA&#x02013;&#x003b2;-gal, senescence-associated &#x003b2;-galactosidase; SAHF, senescence-associated heterochromatic focus; TB, Triton buffer; WCE, whole cell extract.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Normal human cells gradually lose replicative capacity after a finite number of cell divisions as a result of telomere shortening and irreversibly enter the growth-arrested state called replicative senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hayflick and Moorhead, 1961</xref>). This process is accompanied by a series of changes, including cell enlargement, increased acidic &#x003b2;-galactosida se activity (senescence-associated &#x003b2;-galactosidase [SA&#x02013;&#x003b2;-gal]), and alterations of chromatin structures. Replicative senescence has been suggested to represent certain aspects of organismal aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campisi, 2005</xref>).</p><p>It is known that cells also enter a state that is indistinguishable from replicative senescence after exposure to sublethal doses of various types of stress, including reactive oxygen species, oncogenic activation, and inappropriate culture conditions. Such a stress-induced state is called premature senescence or stress-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Serrano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ramirez et al., 2001</xref>). Accordingly, cellular senescence refers to both replicative and premature senescence. Although the stimuli inducing the two types of senescence appear to be considerably diverse (telomere dependent and independent), the stress-induced MAPK p38 plays a key role in signaling such diverse stimuli to induce both types of senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ishikawa, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Cellular senescence is not a condition that simply causes organismal aging to endanger the survival of individuals. Instead, it has been hypothesized that cellular senescence plays an adaptive role in preventing cells from immortalization and neoplastic transformation in vitro and plays a role in tumor suppression in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lowe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campisi, 2005</xref>). Indeed, it was recently reported that senescent cells exist in several types of premalignant tumors in vivo and that cellular senescence is required to prevent tumorigenesis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Braig and Schmitt, 2006</xref>). Therefore, cellular senescence acts as a barrier to tumorigenesis as apoptosis does by stably suppressing the growth of stressed cells.</p><p>The contribution of cellular senescence to tumor suppression depends on the stable maintenance of growth arrest. Alterations of chromatin structure are believed to account for the irreversible nature of the senescent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Narita et al., 2003</xref>). In the nucleus, DNA is wrapped around histone octamers to form nucleosomes, an array of which, in turn, is packed into higher ordered chromatin structures by the association of linker histone H1 and other chromatin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Thoma et al., 1979</xref>). Senescent cells form characteristic heterochromatin structures called senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Narita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). SAHFs contain methylated histone H3 at Lys9 (H3(K9)me) and heterochromatin protein 1, which are typically detected in heterochromatin. It was also reported that H3(K9)me is enriched at proliferation-promoting gene promoters specifically in senescent cells that are concomitant with the appearance of SAHFs but not in quiescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Narita et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, Suv39h1, a histone methyltransferase for H3K9, is required for oncogene-induced senescence in mouse lymphocytes and for the suppression of lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Braig and Schmitt, 2006</xref>). Therefore, it is suggested that senescent cells maintain the growth-arrested state, at least in part, by stably forming heterochromatin at proliferation-promoting gene loci.</p><p>The molecular mechanism of SAHF formation remains poorly understood. Although histone chaperones Asf1a and histone regulation A have been reported to play a role in SAHF formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), it is not known how these chaperones induce SAHFs. In this study, we have found an unexpected role of histone H1 in cellular senescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Individual SAHFs originate from individual chromosomes</title><p>SAHFs are characterized by numerous, highly condensed granular DNAs spreading throughout the nucleus, as shown in WI-38 cells that were induced to senesce by the retroviral expression of oncogenic Ras (RasG12V; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, bottom). SAHFs were observed in &#x0003e;80% of RasG12V-transfected cells as early as day 1 after drug selection. However, the degree of chromatin condensation appeared to increase during the following 7 d, during which the senescent state was stably maintained.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>A single SAHF originates from a single chromosome.</bold> (A) Similar sizes of SAHFs and inactive X chromosomes.

The probe stained two equal-sized metaphase chromosomes in WI-38 cell metaphase spreads, showing its specificity (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200604005/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200604005/DC1</ext-link>).

It is known that individual chromosomes occupy nonoverlapping and discrete spaces called chromosome territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cremer and Cremer, 2001</xref>). Previously, it was reported that centromeres are localized at the periphery of chromosome territories in quiescent human lymphocytes and human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Weierich et al., 2003</xref>). We examined the number and position of centromeres in RasG12V-transfected senescent WI-38 cells using antibodies recognizing centromere protein B (CENP-B). Approximately 85% of CENP-B foci were colocalized with SAHF signals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). Conversely, &#x0223c;70% of SAHFs contained one CENP-B focus at their periphery (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and D</xref>). These results suggest that individual SAHFs originate from individual chromosomes.</p><p>We also performed FISH analysis using a probe specific for chromosome 12. Optical sections of the nucleus of RasG12V-transfected senescent WI-38 cells at 0.4-&#x003bc;m intervals showed that two chromosome 12 signals completely overlapped with two SAHFs in all of the five senescent cells exained (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Together, we conclude that each SAHF represents a heterochromatinized portion of an individual chromosome.</p></sec><sec><title>SAHFs are surrounded by the ICD</title><p>It has been proposed that in interphase nuclei, individual chromosomes are surrounded by the interchromosome domain (ICD), where transcription and RNA splicing take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cremer and Cremer, 2001</xref>). To investigate which regions in the nucleus are responsible for transcription in SAHF-positive senescent cells, RNA polymerase II was subjected to immunofluorescence (IF) analysis using specific antibodies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In mock-transfected WI-38 cells, anti-RNA polymerase II signals were diffusely distributed throughout the nucleus. In RasG12V-transfected senescent WI-38 cells, RNA polymerase II was specifically localized in the DAPI-negative regions in a mutually exclusive manner with SAHFs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, bottom). Quantitative analyses revealed that &#x0223c;90% of SAHFs excluded anti-RNA polymerase II signals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). This result is not caused by the inability of the antibody to penetrate SAHFs because anti-H3(K9)me antibody reacted with SAHFs in IF experiments (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>SAHFs are surrounded by the ICD.</bold> (A) Mock- or RasG12V-transfected WI-38 cells were stained with anti-RNA polymerase II antibody and DAPI.

No signals were observed when unlabeled UTP was used instead of BrU, when cells were treated with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml &#x003b1;-amanitin (the concentration that inhibits RNA polymerase II), or when they were treated with RNase A (Fig. S1 B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200604005/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200604005/DC1</ext-link>).

RasG12V-transfected senescent WI-38 cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 and incubated with transcription buffer containing bromo-labeled UTP (BrU). The incorporation of BrU into nascent RNAs was visualized by IF analysis using anti-BrdU antibody. Although the shape of SAHFs was not well preserved after the transcription reaction, small dots of anti-BrU signals were exclusively localized in the DAPI-negative regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Interestingly, relatively large dots of anti-BrU signals were localized at the surface of SAHFs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, bottom enlarged images). Together, we conclude that in SAHF-positive senescent cells, active transcription occurs at the DAPI-negative inter-SAHF regions, particularly at the surface of SAHFs. This result is consistent with a previous report that SAHFs do not contain active sites for transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Narita et al., 2003</xref>) and with our hypothesis that the DAPI-negative regions correspond to ICDs (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>SAHFs do not show histone modifications that characterize other types of chromatin condensation</title><p>Three types of condensed chromatin are characterized by specific posttranslational modifications of core histones: phosphorylations of histone H3 at Ser10 and Ser28 (H3(S10)ph and H3(S28)ph) in mitotic chromosomes, phosphorylation of histone H2B at Ser14 (H2B(S14)ph) in apoptotic chromatin, and methylation of histone H3 at Lys9 (H3(K9)me) in transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Peterson and Laniel, 2004</xref>). It has been argued that SAHFs represent transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin because SAHFs are colocalized with H3(K9)me and heterochromatin protein 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Narita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>To investigate to which of these distinct chromatin condensations SAHFs are related, we examined the posttranslational modifications of histone H2B and histone H3 in RasG12V-transfected senescent WI-38 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In IF experiments, neither anti-H3(S10)ph, anti-H3(S28)ph, nor anti-H2B(S14)ph antibodies stained SAHFs in senescent WI-38 cells, whereas they stained mitotic WI-38 chromosomes and apoptotic HeLa nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Similarly, in immunoblotting experiments, neither anti-H3(S10)ph nor anti-H3(S28)ph antibodies detected substantial protein bands in acid-extracted (AE) histone fractions derived from mock- or RasG12V-transfected WI-38 cells, whereas strong signals were observed in histone fractions from colcemid-treated HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Although anti-H2B(S14)ph signals were observed in histone fractions derived from mock- and RasG12V-transfected WI-38 cells, they were much weaker than those observed in colcemid- or UV-treated HeLa-derived histone fractions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). These results indicate that SAHFs are a type of chromatin condensation that is distinct from those found in mitotic chromosomes or apoptotic cells. Anti-H3(K9)me antibody reacted with SAHFs in senescent cells as well as the whole nuclear regions in mock-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Narita et al., 2003</xref>). Importantly, however, immunoblotting analysis of AE fractions using anti-H3(K9)me antibody revealed that the total amount of H3(K9)me per unit cell (calibrated by anti-H2B signals) was not substantially different between mock- and RasG12V-transfected WI-38 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>), suggesting that the apparently strong anti-H3(K9)me signals at SAHFs reflect the condensation of DNAs.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>SAHFs do not show histone modifications that characterize three types of chromatin condensation.</bold> (A) Mock- or RasG12V-transfected WI-38 cells as well as HeLa cells irradiated with 100 Jm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> UV rays (HeLa-UV) were stained with antihistone antibodies and DAPI.

The coexpression of HA-HMGA2 and N fusion 1 led to similar results, but the coexpression of HA-HMGA2 and HA-H1 did not (Fig. S5), suggesting that the removal of endogenous histone H1 from chromatin by N-fusion histone H1 rather than the production of recombinant histone H1 itself is important for SAHF formation. Together, these results indicate that the simultaneous overexpression of HA-HMGA2 and N-fusion histone H1 leads to SAHF formation. However, cells coexpressing HA-HMGA2 and N fusion 2 did not show the accumulation of p16, at least up to day 3 after drug selection (unpublished data).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we found that the induction of senescence phenotypes is accompanied by the loss of linker histone H1 from and the accumulation of HMGA2 to chromatin. The loss of histone H1 is not simply through the repression of histone H1 mRNA expression but is most likely through a posttranslational mechanism. The ectopic expression of N-terminally EGFP-tagged histone H1 in WI-38 cells acutely induces senescence phenotypes except SAHF formation and p16 accumulation, which is concomitant with a decrease in the chromatin-bound endogenous histone H1 protein level. This result suggests that distinct pathways are responsible for p53-p21-pRb&#x02013;dependent growth arrest and SAHF formation with or without p16 accumulation in cellular senescence. Notably, when HMGA2 was coexpressed in this condition, significant amounts of SAHFs were formed (P, 0.001), suggesting that the substitution of HMGA2 for histone H1 is required for SAHF formation. Previously, it was reported that the amount of histone H1 protein was decreased in replicative senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mitsui et al., 1980</xref>). However, the biological significance of that observation has remained a mystery. We suggest that SAHFs are a novel type of chromatin condensation involving alterations in linker DNA&#x02013;binding proteins.</p><sec><title>SAHFs are a novel type of chromatin condensation</title><p>We propose that individual SAHFs originate from individual chromosomes. This proposition is based on several lines of evidence. The majority of SAHFs contained one centromere at their periphery and was surrounded by DAPI-negative regions where RNA polymerase II exists and de novo transcription occurs. Such features of the DAPI-negative regions have been proposed and described for ICD, a system of channels that run between chromosome territories and metabolize and transport RNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cremer and Cremer, 2001</xref>). Finally, the painting probe for chromosome 12 stained exactly one SAHF.</p><p>A recent study has demonstrated the presence of RNA transcripts and transcription factors inside the chromosome territory, challenging the conventional ICD model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Williams, 2003</xref>). A revised model has been developed in which a single chromosome territory is composed of condensed chromatin subdomains as well as channels canalizing the territory and ultimately draining into ICDs. Active genes are proposed to exist on the surface of the condensed chromatin subdomains inside the territory. We found that RNA polymerase II exists more or less diffusely throughout the nucleus in young WI-38 cells, supporting this revised model. However, we also found that RNA polymerase II and RNA transcripts are excluded from SAHFs in senescent cells. These observations suggest that SAHF is a heterochromatinized portion of an individual chromosome whose chromatin is so tightly condensed that active genes are virtually excluded.</p><p>SAHFs are a novel type of chromatin condensation not only from a cytological viewpoint but also from a biochemical viewpoint. We found that SAHFs do not show the phosphorylation of histone H3 at either Ser10 or Ser28 or the phosphorylation of histone H2B at Ser14, which are hallmarks of mitotic and apoptotic chromatins, respectively. It has been reported that SAHFs exhibit features of transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Narita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with such earlier studies, we also observed that SAHFs were strongly stained with anti-H3(K9)me antibody. However, we found that the total amount of H3(K9)me remained unchanged at least for 1 wk after the induction of senescence, during which the majority of cells became SAHF positive. These results suggest that although de novo histone methylation may occur locally and repress gene expression at some particular gene loci, a genome-wide increase in the total amount of H3(K9)me does not occur in senescent cells. Although these results do not exclude the involvement of transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin in SAHFs, they suggest that SAHFs are generated by a mechanism that should be distinguished from those involved in conventional chromosome condensation and heterochromatinization.</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of histone H1 and senescence phenotypes</title><p>We found that linker histone H1 is lost from senescent cells. Because it is generally believed that histone H1 facilitates chromatin condensation and acts mainly as a transcriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hayes and Hansen, 2001</xref>), it was unexpected that histone H1 was lost instead of increased in SAHFs. Although we could not definitely conclude whether the loss of histone H1 is causally linked to the induction of senescence phenotypes and SAHF formation, the following observations suggest that the alterations in histone H1 metabolism are involved in a senescence-inducing mechanism. First, the amount of histone H1 protein was lost or considerably reduced in a variety of cellular senescence occurring in different cell types and through different stimuli. Second, the extent of histone H1 loss in such occasions was well correlated with the frequency of SAHF formation. Finally, senescence phenotypes except SAHF formation and p16 accumulation were induced in young WI-38 cells by the ectopic expression of N fusion but not of C fusion, HA-H1, or untagged recombinant H1 proteins. These proteins were produced at similar levels (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, B and F</xref>) and were efficiently bound to chromatin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref> and Fig. S3 A), suggesting that senescence was not induced by nonspecific effects caused by the overproduction of nonfunctional histone H1 proteins.</p><p>Interestingly, the senescence induction and reduced level of endogenous histone H1 were well correlated: only N fusions showed both effects, whereas the other recombinant histone H1 proteins showed neither. We do not know why N fusions but not C fusion affect the level of endogenous histone H1 and induce SAHF formation. It has been reported that N-terminal GFP-tagged histone H1.1 binds to chromatin with higher affinity than C-terminal GFP-tagged histone H1.1 in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hendzel et al., 2004</xref>). It is possible that such different affinities cause different stabilities of endogenous histone H1 protein. Alternatively, N-terminal GFP may perturb the incorporation of endogenous histone H1 into neighboring nucleosomes by steric hindrance, for example.</p><p>Embryonic stem cells homozygously deleted of three out of six somatic histone H1 variant genes were viable and showed apparently normal growth. Interestingly, however, the DNA methylation and expression patterns of some specific loci, including imprinted genes, were deregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fan et al., 2005</xref>). These results raise the possibility that the absence of histone H1 in senescent cells may specifically affect the expression of genes involved in senescence phenotypes (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 G</xref>).</p><p>The amounts of histone proteins, especially those of chromatin-unbound forms, are strictly regulated in cells. It has been reported that the chromatin-unbound free core histones are degraded in a Rad53-dependent manner in yeast. In <italic>rad53</italic> cells, chromatin-unbound core histones persist at the completion of S phase, leading to impaired cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gunjan et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, another interesting possibility is that the production of free histone H1, not the reduction of chromatin-bound histone H1, positively triggers a signal leading to senescence (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 G</xref>). A hypothesis reminiscent of this case was reported previously: after exposure to x rays, histone H1.2, a histone H1 variant, moves to the cytoplasm, where it induces cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release from mitochondria to activate caspase-dependent destruction cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Konishi et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Altered balance between histone H1 and HMGA2 bound to chromatin in SAHF formation</title><p>Recent studies have emphasized the dynamic binding of histone H1 to chromatin. Histone H1 associates with and dissociates from chromatin in a rapid turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lever et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bustin et al., 2005</xref>). Histone H1 dissociation from chromatin may be enhanced by activities that destabilize the histone H1&#x02013;chromatin association. HMG proteins are the second most abundant chromatin proteins after histones and consist of three subfamilies: HMGA, HMGB, and HMGN. It was reported that HMG proteins and histone H1 compete with each other for the same binding site, the linker DNA. Specifically, microinjected excess amounts of HMG proteins leads to high turnover rates and reduces the residence time of endogenous chromatin-bound histone H1, presumably by being excluded from chromatin by the excess HMG proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Catez et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>On the surface, the failure of the ectopic expression of histone H1 to prevent RasG12V-induced senescence appears to refute the causative role of histone H1 loss in senescence induction. However, the amounts of chromatin-bound HMGA2 and chromatin-bound histone H1 were similarly increased and reduced, respectively, in RasG12V-expressing cells irrespective of histone H1 coexpression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9 C</xref>), suggesting that RasG12V expression shifts the balance of HMGA2 and histone H1 association with the linker DNA in favor of HMGA2 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 G</xref>). The ectopic expression of histone H1 may fail to restore the balance in favor of histone H1 to a degree that is sufficient to prevent senescence in the RasG12V-expressing condition. It is not clear why the ectopic expression of histone H1 even by the strong promoters failed to restore the chromatin-bound histone H1 protein level in RasG12V-transfected cells. It is possible that histone H1 is actively removed from chromatin in such cells. Alternatively, senescent cell chromatin may be incompetent to incorporate newly synthesized histone H1. It is also not clear how endogenous histone H1 disappears from senescent cells. Further studies are warranted to determine whether histone H1 loss plays a causative role in senescence induction.</p><p>When HMGA2 was ectopically expressed in young WI-38 cells to the level found in RasG12V-expressing cells, no senescence phenotypes were induced (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 D</xref> and Fig. S4). Conversely, when the amount of chromatin-bound histone H1 was reduced by N-fusion expression, no SAHFs were formed either (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>). SAHFs were formed only when N fusions accompanying histone H1 loss and HMGA2 were coexpressed. We hypothesize that both the reduced association of histone H1 and the increased association of HMGA2 with chromatin, which reflect the substitution of HMGA2 for histone H1, are required for SAHF formation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 G</xref>). Therefore, SAHFs may be viewed as heterochromatin in which the balance of the two major linker DNA&#x02013;binding proteins (histone H1 and HMGA2) is altered.</p><p>We also found that the coexpression of N fusion 2 and HA-HMGA2 did not induce p16 accumulation, at least up to day 3 after drug selection.
