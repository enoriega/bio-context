PMC2193139	false	abstract	1	1	We have identified and characterized a novel src homology 2 ( SH2 ) and pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain containing adaptor protein , designated Bam32 ( for B cell adaptor molecule of 32 kD ) .
PMC2193139	false	abstract	1	2	cDNAs encoding the human and mouse Bam32 coding sequences were isolated and the human bam32 gene was mapped to chromosome 4q25-q27 .
PMC2193139	false	abstract	1	3	Bam32 is expressed by B lymphocytes , but not T lymphocytes or nonhematopoietic cells .
PMC2193139	false	abstract	1	4	Human germinal center B cells show increased Bam32 expression , and resting B cells rapidly upregulate expression of Bam32 after ligation of CD40 , but not immunoglobulin M. Bam32 is tyrosine phosphorylated upon B cell antigen receptor ( BCR ) ligation or pervanadate stimulation and associates with phospholipase Cgamma2 .
PMC2193139	false	abstract	1	5	After BCR ligation , Bam32 is recruited to the plasma membrane through its PH domain .
PMC2193139	false	abstract	1	6	Membrane recruitment requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) activity and an intact PI ( 3,4,5 ) P3 binding motif , suggesting that membrane association occurs through binding to 3-phosphoinositides .
PMC2193139	false	abstract	1	7	Expression of Bam32 in B cells leads to a dose dependent inhibition of BCR induced activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) , which is blocked by deletion of the PH domain or mutation of the PI ( 3,4,5 ) P3 binding motif .
PMC2193139	false	abstract	1	8	Thus , Bam32 represents a novel B cell associated adaptor that regulates BCR signaling downstream of PI3K .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	2	9	The population of B lymphocytes present in peripheral lymphoid tissues is dynamically maintained by processes that balance the continuous output from the bone marrow and proliferation in response to antigens with B cell terminal differentiation and death .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	2	10	The choices between the alternative fates of proliferation , differentiation , and death , are largely determined by intracellular signaling cascades triggered by receptor-ligand interactions .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	2	11	The B cell antigen receptor ( BCR ) is a central regulator of B cell fate   .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	2	12	BCR signaling is required for survival and recirculation of naive B cells   as well as for antigen specific immune responses .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	2	13	Ligation of the BCR by antigen can have different outcomes depending on the differentiation stage of the B cell , the molecular form of antigen , and the immunological context of the antigen encounter   .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	2	14	These different outcomes can be due to differences in quality or quantity of signals emanating from the BCR itself    and and or differential signaling through other key receptors such as CD19 , CD22 , CD40 , CD72 , CD95 , CDw150 , and FcgammaRII    .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	2	15	These coreceptors can act by directly modifying receptor proximal events in BCR signaling or by activating additional signaling pathways which influence the outcome of BCR signaling .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	3	16	Ligation of the BCR leads to activation of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) , which regulate several downstream signaling pathways   .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	3	17	These include phospholipase C ( PLC ) gamma , which , upon activation , hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol    bisphosphate ( PI ( 4,5 ) P2 ) to produce inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate ( IP3 ) , which triggers the release of calcium from intracellular stores , and diacylglycerol ( DAG ) , which can activate protein kinase C isoforms .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	3	18	Other pathways that are activated downstream of PTKs include the Ras pathway   and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway   .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	3	19	Activation of PI3K leads to activation of the serine and threonine kinase Akt      and regulates the membrane association and function of the Tec family PTK , Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( Btk )     .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	3	20	Adaptor proteins such as B cell linker ( BLNK ) , which contain protein protein interaction domains but no catalytic activity , play critical roles in linking BCR induced PTK activation to downstream effectors     .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	3	21	The BCR signaling cascade ultimately leads to activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) and nuclear factor of kappa binding ( NF-kappaB )         .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	3	22	In at least one case , alternative outcomes of BCR signaling correlate with differential activation of these transcription factors  .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	4	23	During B cell responses to thymus dependent antigens , key B cell activation and differentiation events occur within germinal centers ( GCs )     .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	4	24	The GC response is initiated when B cells activated by encounter with antigen and cognate T cell help migrate to the B cell follicles and begin proliferating rapidly in association with the follicular dendritic cell ( FDC ) network to give rise to a GC .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	4	25	GC B cells begin a complex differentiation program that incorporates somatic hypermutation coupled with selection for high-affinity antigen specific Ig , Ig class switching , and differentiation into memory B cells or plasma cells .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	4	26	GC B cells represent a distinct differentiation state and display several unique properties such as a predisposition to apoptosis and reexpression of genes expressed during early B cell development       .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	4	27	The molecular basis for B cell activation and differentiation processes occurring within GCs is poorly understood .
PMC2193139	false	sec-1	4	28	In this study , we have undertaken a screen for GC associated genes and report the identification and characterization of a novel B cell restricted signaling molecule that is highly expressed in GC B cells and appears to regulate B cell activation pathways downstream of PI3K .

PMC2193139	false	sec-13	22	102	Expression of Bam32 in human tissues was determined by Northern blot analysis           .

PMC2193139	false	sec-13	22	105	Bam32 expression was also observed in trachea and placenta , but not in 14 other nonlymphoid tissues including brain , heart , kidney , liver and skeletal muscle , indicating that expression is largely confined to cells of the immune system .
PMC2193139	false	sec-13	22	106	Consistent with the restricted tissue distribution pattern , RT-PCR analyses indicated that Bam32 is expressed in all B cell lines examined , but not in T cell , epithelial cell , fibroblast , or myelocytic leukemia lines           .

PMC2193139	true	sec-14	23	108	Bam32 Expression Is Increased upon B Cell Activation .
PMC2193139	false	sec-14	24	109	Since Bam32 was isolated as a GC associated gene , it was of interest to compare the expression of Bam32 at different stages of B cell differentiation .
PMC2193139	false	sec-14	24	110	Therefore , we fractionated human tonsillar B cells into naive , GC , and memory subsets on the basis of CD38 and IgD expression   .
PMC2193139	false	sec-14	24	111	While Bam32 transcripts were detected in all fractions , GC B cells expressed fourfold higher levels than naive B cells           .

PMC2193139	false	sec-14	24	113	These results suggest that Bam32 expression levels are modulated during B cell activation and differentiation .

PMC2193139	false	sec-14	24	116	Together , these results suggest that Bam32 expression is specifically increased during T cell dependent activation , is maintained at high levels during the subsequent GC response , and then decreases upon differentiation to memory B cells .
PMC2193139	true	sec-15	25	117	Bam32 Is Phosphorylated on Tyrosine and Associates with PLCgamma2 after BCR Ligation or Pervanadate Stimulation .
PMC2193139	false	sec-15	26	118	To determine whether Bam32 associates with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins after B cell activation , Bam32 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of resting or activated B cells and the precipitates were run on SDS-PAGE and blotted with biotinylated phosphotyrosine specific mAb followed by streptavidin-peroxidase           .
PMC2193139	false	sec-15	26	119	Two predominant tyrosine phosphorylated proteins running at ~ 140 and 35 and 36 kD were detected in Bam32 immunoprecipitates from BCR- or pervanadate stimulated Ramos cells .
PMC2193139	false	sec-15	26	120	As expected , neither of these bands was observed in immunoprecipitates from pervanadate stimulated Jurkat cells , which do not express Bam32 .
PMC2193139	false	sec-15	26	121	We found no evidence for a phosphoprotein running at 32 kD ; however , when Bam32 immunoprecipitates were blotted with polyclonal Bam32 antibodies , an additional band of ~ 35 and 36 kD was detectable after BCR or pervanadate activation                   .
PMC2193139	false	sec-15	26	122	This band was not present in unstimulated cells and comigrated with the 35 and 36 kD band detected by antiphosphotyrosine blotting , indicating that it represents tyrosine phosphorylated Bam32 .
PMC2193139	false	sec-15	26	123	Consistent with this conclusion , myc epitope tagged Bam32 also underwent a bandshift and was tyrosine phosphorylated after pervanadate stimulation           .
PMC2193139	false	sec-15	27	124	Western blot analyses identified the 140-kD associated protein as PLCgamma2 , whereas neither PLCgamma1 nor BLNK could be detected in Bam32 immunoprecipitates           .
PMC2193139	false	sec-15	27	125	Although we can detect some constitutive association of Bam32 with PLCgamma2 , association is substantially increased after activation           .
PMC2193139	false	sec-15	27	126	A Bam32 SH2 domain fusion protein bound in vitro to tyrosine phosphorylated PLCgamma2 immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane , but not to CD22           , syk , or SH2 domain containing inositol 5-phosphatase ( SHIP ) ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the Bam32-PLCgamma2 interaction is direct and mediated by the SH2 domain .
