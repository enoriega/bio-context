PMC2211849	false	abstract	1	1	Linker for activation of B cells ( LAB , also called NTAL ; a product of wbscr5 gene ) is a newly identified transmembrane adaptor protein that is expressed in B cells , NK cells , and mast cells .
PMC2211849	false	abstract	1	2	Upon BCR activation , LAB is phosphorylated and interacts with Grb2 .
PMC2211849	false	abstract	1	3	LAB is capable of rescuing thymocyte development in LAT deficient mice .
PMC2211849	false	abstract	1	4	To study the in vivo function of LAB , LAB deficient mice were generated .
PMC2211849	false	abstract	1	5	Although disruption of the Lab gene did not affect lymphocyte development , it caused mast cells to be hyperresponsive to stimulation via the FcepsilonRI , evidenced by enhanced Erk activation , calcium mobilization , degranulation , and cytokine production .
PMC2211849	false	abstract	1	6	These data suggested that LAB negatively regulates mast cell function .
PMC2211849	false	abstract	1	7	However , mast cells that lacked both linker for activation of T cells ( LAT ) and LAB proteins had a more severe block in FcepsilonRI mediated signaling than LAT-/- mast cells , demonstrating that LAB also shares a redundant function with LAT to play a positive role in FcepsilonRI mediated signaling .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	2	8	Engagement of the high affinity IgE receptor ( FcepsilonRI ) at the surface of mast cells initiates signaling cascades leading to Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) activation , calcium mobilization , degranulation , and cytokine production      .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	2	9	FcepsilonRI , a member of the immunoreceptor superfamily , is composed of alpha , beta , and the homodimeric gamma chains    .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	2	10	The alpha chain binds IgE , and the beta and gamma chains contain a signal transducing immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ( ITAM ) in their cytoplasmic domains .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	2	11	Upon activation of FcepsilonRI by multivalent antigens bound on IgE , the Src family tyrosine kinase ( protein tyrosin kinase [ PTK ] ) , Lyn , is activated and phosphorylates the tyrosine residues within the ITAMs of the beta and gamma chains .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	2	12	Syk then binds to the phosphorylated ITAMs via its tandem Src homology 2 domains and is further activated by Lyn       .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	2	13	These activated tyrosine kinases further phosphorylate downstream signaling molecules .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	2	14	The importance of these tyrosine kinases in mast cell function has been demonstrated in cells deficient in these PTKs .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	2	15	Syk deficient mast cells fail to degranulate and secrete cytokines when stimulated through the FcepsilonRI    .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	2	16	Compared with Syk deficiency , Lyn deficiency has a less severe phenotype .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	2	17	Lyn-/- mast cells have impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins and delayed Ca2+ mobilization , but degranulation , MAPK activation , and cytokine production occur normally    .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	2	18	This partial signaling defect caused by Lyn deficiency is likely due to the presence of another Src family PTK , Fyn     .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	2	19	Although Fyn-/- mast cells are relatively normal in FcepsilonRI mediated tyrosine phosphorylation , MAPK activation , and Ca2+ flux , they are defective in IgE dependent degranulation     .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	2	20	Fyn functions to phosphorylate Gab2 , an adaptor molecule that is important in FcepsilonRI mediated phosphotidylinositide 3-kinase activation         .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	2	21	Therefore , both Lyn and Fyn are required in FcepsilonRI mediated signaling pathway .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	3	22	After activation of these PTKs , many signaling proteins are phosphorylated .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	3	23	One of the prominently phosphorylated proteins downstream of FcepsilonRI engagement is linker for activation of T cells ( LAT ) .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	3	24	LAT function has been clearly demonstrated in T cells .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	3	25	Upon T cell activation , it is phosphorylated and interacts with Grb2 , Gads , and PLC-gamma1        .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	3	26	Through binding to these molecules , LAT couples TCR engagement to MAPK activation and calcium flux .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	3	27	In LAT deficient Jurkat cells , TCR mediated MAPK activation and calcium flux are completely blocked         .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	3	28	LAT is also required during T cell development .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	3	29	LAT deficient mice lack mature T cells , and thymocyte development is blocked at the double negative stage     .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	3	30	In LAT-/- mast cells , although tyrosine phosphorylation of FcepsilonRI , Syk , and Vav is intact , FcepsilonRI mediated phosphorylation of SLP-76 , PLC-gamma1 , and PLC-gamma2 , MAPK activation , and calcium mobilization are significantly reduced , leading to a reduction in mast cell degranulation and cytokine production     .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	3	31	Mutational studies show that four membrane-distal tyrosines in LAT are required for LAT function in FcepsilonRI mediated signaling     .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	3	32	In comparison with the LAT deficient Jurkat cells , FcepsilonRI mediated signaling and effector function in LAT-/- mast cells are not completely blocked .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	3	33	LAT-/- mast cells still flux calcium and produce cytokines after engagement of FcepsilonRI , albeit at reduced levels .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	3	34	These data suggest that FcepsilonRI mediated signaling is not totally dependent on LAT .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	4	35	Recently , a novel transmembrane adaptor protein , linker for activation of B cells ( LAB ) / non T cell activation linker ( NTAL ) , was identified         .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	4	36	Similar to LAT , LAB has multiple tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic tail , five of which are within a Grb2 binding motif .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	4	37	LAB also has a palmitoylation motif and is localized to lipid rafts .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	4	38	LAB is expressed in B cells , NK cells , mast cells , and other cell types .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	4	39	Upon BCR or Fc receptor engagement , LAB is phosphorylated and interacts with Grb2 ; however , it is incapable of binding PLC-gamma1 or PLC-gamma2        .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	4	40	Functionally , LAB is able to rescue thymocyte development in LAT-/- mice .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	4	41	However , transgenic mice expressing LAB in T cells develop a Th2 autoimmune disease similarly to the LAT Y136F knockin mice , suggesting that LAB resembles the LAT mutant without the PLC-gamma1 site     .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	4	42	These data suggest that , although LAT and LAB share a subset of functions in signaling , they function differently .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	5	43	To study how LAB functions in vivo , we generated LAB deficient mice .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	5	44	Although disruption of the Lab gene had no significant impact on T and B cell development , it caused mast cell hyperresponsiveness to stimulation via FcepsilonRI , suggesting that LAB negatively regulates mast cell function .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	5	45	Interestingly , mast cells deficient in both Lat and Lab genes had further reduction in FcepsilonRI mediated signaling and mast cell function in comparison with LAT-/- mast cells .
PMC2211849	false	sec-1	5	46	Thus , LAB also plays a positive role in FcepsilonRI mediated signaling .

PMC2211849	false	sec-19	49	308	Transgenic mice that express LAB in T cells under the CD2 promoter have a similar autoimmune phenotype as the LAT Y136F knockin mice             .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	49	309	These mice have splenomegaly and massive lymphocyte infiltration .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	49	310	T cells in these mice are hyperactivated and produce large amounts of Th2 cytokines .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	49	311	Therefore , LAB functions like the LAT mutant without the PLC-gamma1 site .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	49	312	In LAT-/- mast cells , more LAB was phosphorylated .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	49	313	Although LAB does not bind PLC-gamma1 or PLC-gamma2 directly , perhaps LAB could recruit PLC-gamma1 or PLC-gamma2 to the membrane through binding of the Gads-SLP76-PLC-gamma complex .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	49	314	Since recruitment through LAB might be not as efficient as through LAT , FcepsilonRI mediated calcium flux is thus compromised in LAT-/- cells .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	49	315	When both molecules are absent as in 2KO cells , there is no recruitment PLC-gamma1 or PLC-gamma2 to the membrane , resulting in a complete block in FcepsilonRI mediated calcium flux .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	50	316	It is surprising that disruption of the Lab gene enhanced FcepsilonRI mediated signal transduction .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	50	317	Since LAB and LAT have similar structures , we expected to see reduced FcepsilonRI mediated signaling when the Lab gene was deleted .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	50	318	The reason for this enhanced mast cell function is not entirely clear .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	50	319	One possibility is that LAB and LAT might compete for binding of Grb2 .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	50	320	Without LAB , LAT could bind more Grb2 and their associated proteins , thus enhancing FcepsilonRI mediated MAPK activation and calcium flux .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	50	321	A more likely possibility , as suggested in       , is that LAT and LAB compete for localization to lipid rafts .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	50	322	In WT mast cells , LAT is the dominant one .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	50	323	It keeps most of the LAB protein away from lipid rafts .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	50	324	In the absence of LAT , more LAB moves into lipid rafts , leading to more tyrosine phosphorylation of LAB and further compensation for loss of LAT .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	50	325	This is probably the reason why LAT deficiency only causes a partial block in FcepsilonRI mediated signaling .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	50	326	In the absence of LAB , more LAT moves into lipid rafts and binds more signaling proteins , thus enhancing FcepsilonRI mediated phosphorylation of PLC-gamma1 or PLC-gamma2 , MAPK activation , calcium flux , degranulation , and cytokine production .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	50	327	Therefore , LAB might negatively regulate FcepsilonRI mediated signaling by competing with LAT to localize to lipid rafts .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	50	328	However , whether lipid rafts exist and function still remains controversial     .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	50	329	Our data in        might simply indicate changes of LAT or LAB in its physical properties , such as palmitoylation , or subcellular localization when the other one is absent .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	50	330	How and at what levels LAB competes with LAT to localize to rafts remain to be investigated in the future .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	51	331	Although we observed enhanced FcepsilonRI mediated signaling in mast cells derived from BM cells of LAB-/- mice , we did not see a significant enhancement of anaphylaxis in vivo .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	51	332	It is possible that there is a compensatory mechanism in vivo to control hyperactive mast cells .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	51	333	Interestingly , the basal IgE level in naive LAB-/- mice is higher than the basal IgE level in WT mice ( unpublished data ) .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	51	334	Mast cells in LAB-/- mice might bind less anti-DNP-IgE after sensitization than cells in WT mice , since exogenous IgE has to compete with endogenous IgE to bind FcepsilonRI .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	51	335	Even though FcepsilonRI mediated signaling is enhanced in LAB-/- mast cells , engagement of the FcepsilonRI in LAB-/- mice might not be as efficient as it in WT mice .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	51	336	It is also possible that cross linking with DNP-HSA , which induces anaphylaxis in sensitized mice , already causes a very strong stimulation in WT mice ; therefore , it might be difficult to observe enhanced mast cell function using this assay .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	51	337	In addition , because there are some variations in the anaphylaxis assay even among different mice with the same genetic background , it is difficult to detect enhanced mast cell mediated anaphylaxis even if it does occur in vivo .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	52	338	Compared with the effect of LAT deficiency on T cell development , disruption of Lab did not have a significant impact on B cell development as normal populations of pro- , pre - , and mature B cells are present in LAB deficient mice .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	52	339	Therefore , even though LAB can substitute LAT in T cell development and partially rescues calcium flux in LAT deficient cells , LAB does not function like LAT in B cells .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	52	340	It is possible that in B cells BCR mediated signaling does not use a LAT like molecule to signal .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	52	341	In T cells , recruitment of SLP-76 and PLC-gamma1 to the membrane and further activation of Ras-MAPK and calcium flux depend on LAT ; however , in B cells SLP-65 / BLNK can be recruited to the BCR by interacting directly with the Igalpha chain         .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	52	342	BLNK then recruits PLC-gamma1 / gamma2 to the membrane by interacting with them directly .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	52	343	It is also possible that other membrane associated molecules might exist to function like LAT in B cells .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	52	344	Although LAB deficiency had no effect on B cell development , we could not exclude the possibility that B cell function is affected by disruption of Lab .
PMC2211849	false	sec-19	52	345	We are currently investigating whether BCR mediated signaling , B cell function , and immune responses are normal in these mice .
