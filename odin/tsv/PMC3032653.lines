PMC3032653	true	article-title	0	0	Spatially restricted activation of RhoA at epithelial junctions by p114RhoGEF drives junction formation and morphogenesis
PMC3032653	false	abstract	1	1	Signalling by the GTPase RhoA , a key regulator of epithelial cell behaviour , can stimulate opposing processes : RhoA can promote junction formation and apical constriction , as well as reduced adhesion and cell spreading ,  .
PMC3032653	false	abstract	1	2	Molecular mechanisms are thus required that ensure spatially restricted and process specific RhoA activation .
PMC3032653	false	abstract	1	3	For many fundamental processes , including assembly of the epithelial junctional complex , such mechanisms are still unknown .
PMC3032653	false	abstract	1	4	Here we show that p114RhoGEF is a junction associated protein that drives RhoA signalling at the junctional complex and regulates tight junction assembly and epithelial morphogenesis .
PMC3032653	false	abstract	1	5	p114RhoGEF is required for RhoA activation at cell-cell junctions , and its depletion stimulates non junctional Rho signalling and induction of myosin phosphorylation along the basal domain .
PMC3032653	false	abstract	1	6	Depletion of GEF-H1 , a RhoA activator inhibited by junctional recruitment , does not reduce junction associated RhoA activation .
PMC3032653	false	abstract	1	7	p114RhoGEF associates with a complex containing myosin II , Rock II and the junctional adaptor cingulin , indicating that p114RhoGEF is a component of a junction associated Rho signalling module that drives spatially restricted activation of RhoA to regulate junction formation and epithelial morphogenesis .
