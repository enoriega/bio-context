PMC2195994	false	abstract	1	1	Cdc42Hs is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and is required for neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells .

PMC2195994	false	abstract	1	3	Here , we identify the 58-kD substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase ( IRS-58 ) as a Cdc42Hs target .
PMC2195994	false	abstract	1	4	IRS-58 is a brain enriched protein comprising at least four protein protein interaction sites : a Cdc42Hs binding site , an Src homology ( SH ) 3 binding site , an SH3 domain , and a tryptophan , tyrptophan ( WW ) - binding domain .

PMC2195994	false	sec-21	48	251	Since IRS-58 mRNAs are highly expressed in brain , we also investigated the effects of its overexpression in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells .

PMC2195994	false	sec-21	48	254	IRS-58 was also able to induce neurite outgrowth in similar experiments .
PMC2195994	false	sec-21	48	255	Phase-contrast analysis of IRS-58-overexpressing N1E-115 cells clearly shows that it induces the formation of robust filopodia .
PMC2195994	false	sec-21	48	256	The morphology of N1E-115 cells overexpressing IRS-58 was different from that seen on serum withdrawal or Cdc42Hs overexpression .
PMC2195994	false	sec-21	48	257	IRS-58 neurites were much thicker and highly branched , and filopodia were evident all along the neurite surface .
PMC2195994	false	sec-21	48	258	Some cells had neurites with multiple branches , each associated with large and spiky growth cones .
PMC2195994	false	sec-21	48	259	Thus , IRS-58-induced neurites are complex and lack polarity ( see above ) .
PMC2195994	false	sec-21	48	260	The Cdc42Hs binding defective IRS-58I267N failed to induce neurite outgrowth , and this finding parallels studies in yeast cells where a Cdc42p binding defective Ste20 was unable to induce pseudohyphal growth                    .
PMC2195994	false	sec-21	49	261	IRS-58-induced neurite outgrowth was inhibited by transfection of dominant negative T17N cDNAs , suggesting that Cdc42Hs and Rac1 activity are required for this phenotype .
PMC2195994	false	sec-21	49	262	Interestingly , deletion of the SH3 domain and WW binding domain of IRS-58 eliminated the neurite and growth cone complexity , but neurite extension in N1E-115 cells was still seen .
PMC2195994	false	sec-21	49	263	Therefore , it is possible that proteins that bind either to the SH3 domain , such as atrophin-1 or BA1 , and and or the WW binding domain may be responsible for the morphological complexity observed .

PMC2195994	false	sec-22	51	266	These results suggest that the function of the Cdc4Hs-IRS-58 interaction is to localize an IRS-58 protein complex to F-actin and thereby facilitate morphological change and neurite outgrowth .
