PMC2064233	false	abstract	1	4	We identify enzymes that palmitoylate eNOS in vivo .
PMC2064233	false	abstract	1	5	Transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with the complementary DNA ( cDNA ) for eNOS and 23 cDNA clones encoding the Asp-His-His-Cys motif ( DHHC ) palmitoyl transferase family members showed that five clones ( 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 , and 21 ) enhanced incorporation of [ 3H ] - palmitate into eNOS .
PMC2064233	false	abstract	1	6	Human endothelial cells express all five of these enzymes , which colocalize with eNOS in the Golgi and plasma membrane and interact with eNOS .
PMC2064233	false	abstract	1	7	Importantly , inhibition of DHHC-21 palmitoyl transferase , but not DHHC-3 , in human endothelial cells reduces eNOS palmitoylation , eNOS targeting , and stimulated NO production .
PMC2064233	false	abstract	1	8	Collectively , our data describe five new Golgi targeted DHHC enzymes in human endothelial cells and suggest a regulatory role of DHHC-21 in governing eNOS localization and function .
PMC2064233	false	sec-1	2	9	The production of nitric oxide ( NO ) by the vascular endothelium is important for cardiovascular homeostasis , as endogenous NO regulates many fundamental cellular processes , including growth , mitochondrial respiration , differentiation , and migration .
PMC2064233	false	sec-1	2	10	Endothelial NO synthase ( eNOS or NOS3 ) synthesizes NO in the endothelium lining all blood vessels , and genetic deletion of eNOS causes many cardiovascular phenotypes , including increased blood pressure , impaired angiogenesis , abnormal vascular remodeling , and accelerated atherosclerosis                      .
PMC2064233	false	sec-1	2	11	eNOS is a peripheral membrane protein that is modified by dual acylation ( N myristoylation and S palmitoylation ) , which targets it to specific biological membranes                           .
PMC2064233	false	sec-1	2	12	All dually acylated proteins , including eNOS , src family members , and certain G protein alpha subunits are cotranslationally N myristoylated on cytoplasmic ribosomes followed by posttranslational cysteine palmitoylation .

PMC2064233	false	sec-1	2	14	N myristoylation and S palmitoylation mediate localization of eNOS to the Golgi complex and cholesterol rich microdomains of the plasma membranes , including caveolae and lipid rafts                                                                    .

PMC2064233	false	sec-1	3	16	Little is known about the enzymatic mechanisms for dual palmitoylation in mammalian cells .
PMC2064233	false	sec-1	3	17	This fatty acid modification is reversible , unlike N myristoylation , which is permanent                      .
PMC2064233	false	sec-1	3	18	In the context of eNOS , palmitate turnover is 45 min , whereas myristate turnover occurs with the protein backbone ( both ~ 20 h ;                  .

PMC2064233	false	sec-1	4	20	Recently , a new family of acyl transferase enzymes that catalyzed the protein palmitoylation was discovered                      .
PMC2064233	false	sec-1	4	21	Genetic screens in yeast identified Erf2 and 4                     and Akr1p                     as palmitoyl transferases for yeast Ras2 and casein kinase2 ( Yck2 ) .

PMC2064233	false	sec-1	4	23	Erf2 and 4 or Ark1 share a common region , the Asp-His-His-Cys motif ( DHHC ) , within a cysteine rich domain ( CRD ) .
PMC2064233	false	sec-1	4	24	The DHHC and CRD domains are essential for palmitoyl acyl transferase ( PAT ) activity                                         .
PMC2064233	false	sec-1	4	25	The human homologues of the yeast Erf2 and Erf4 complex are DHHC-9 and a Golgi localized protein designated GCP16 .
PMC2064233	false	sec-1	4	26	This complex has been shown to palmitoylate H- and N-Ras in vitro                         .
PMC2064233	false	sec-1	4	27	23 genes encoding proteins with DHHC-CRD domains have been identified in mouse and human databases                      .
PMC2064233	false	sec-1	4	28	Some of these proteins are known as Golgi specific DHHC zinc finger protein ( GODZ and DHHC -3 ;                     , the c-Abl-associated protein Abl-philin2 ( Aph2 and DHHC -16 ;                 , Sertoli cell DHHC protein ( SERZ-beta and DHHC -7 ;                             , Huntingtin interacting protein 14 ( HIP14 and DHHC -17 ;                    , and DHHC-15 , which palmitoylates the neuronal scaffold protein PSD-95                      .
PMC2064233	false	sec-1	5	29	In the present work , we screened the 23 known DHHCs to examine which isoforms can palmitoylate eNOS .

PMC2064233	false	sec-3	7	33	Human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) 293 cells were cotransfected with each of the palmitoyl transferase cDNAs together with eNOS and the biosynthetic incorporation of 3 [ H ] - palmitate into eNOS examined by fluorography .
PMC2064233	false	sec-3	7	34	As shown in         , only five clones ( DHHC-2 , -3 , -7 , -8 , and -21 ) markedly enhanced incorporation of 3 [ H ] - palmitate into eNOS                                                                   , defining them as putative eNOS PATs .

PMC2064233	false	sec-3	7	36	As shown in         , the incorporation of 3 [ H ] - palmitate into eNOS is reduced by hydroxylamine , demonstrating that this occurs via a thioester linkage similar to the palmitoylation of PSD-95 by DHHC-3 , which was recently described                      .
PMC2064233	false	sec-3	7	37	In addition , mutation in the core DHHC domain of these enzymes ( mutation of DHHC to DHHS ) reduces the incorporation of 3 [ H ] - palmitate into eNOS           , consistent with previous reports                                         .

PMC2064233	false	sec-3	7	42	As displayed in         , transfection of DHHC-21 , but not -11 ( as a control ) , increases the incorporation of 3 [ H ] - palmitate into eNOS , an effect eliminated by mutation of cysteines 15 and 26 to serine ( C15 and 26S eNOS ) .

PMC2064233	false	sec-8	27	159	Although cysteine palmitoylation has long been recognized as important for protein trafficking and function , enzymes responsible for this have been elusive .

PMC2064233	false	sec-8	27	164	In the present study , only DHHC-2 , -3 , -7 , -8 , and -21 significantly increased the incorporation of palmitate into eNOS , suggesting some degree of substrate specificity of the DHHCs .
PMC2064233	false	sec-8	27	165	As DHHC-2 , -3 , and -7 can palmitoylate the nonmyristoylated proteins PSD95 and GalphaS , these candidates are less likely to be specific N-myristoyl-requiring PATs                      .
PMC2064233	false	sec-8	27	166	RNAi mediated knockdown of endogenous DHHC-21 in endothelial cells reduces the incorporation of 3 [ H ] - palmitate into eNOS , mislocalizes eNOS , and reduces agonist stimulated NO release , whereas knock down of DHHC-3 did not reduce NO release , suggesting that although at least five DHHCs can significantly palmitoylate eNOS in transfected cells , DHHC-21 may be a more specific eNOS PAT .
PMC2064233	false	sec-8	27	167	The reasons for the apparent specificity of DHHC-21 toward eNOS in endothelial cells are not known , but it may be due to the amount of DHHC-21 protein relative to other DHHCs expressed in endothelial cells or to the posttranslational modification of DHHCs that may determine its substrate specificity or regulate its activity in a cell specific context .
PMC2064233	false	sec-8	27	168	In addition , we can not rule the possibility that other DHHCs palmitoylate eNOS in endothelial cells , as a substantial knock down of DHHC-21 reduced palmitoylation by only 50 % and NO release by 70 % .

PMC2064233	false	sec-8	28	170	Other interesting findings are that DHHC-2 , -3 , -7 , -8 , and -21 all enhance the transfer of palmitate into eNOS and are strongly colocalized with GM130 , a Golgi matrix protein localized to the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi , consistent with our previous suggestion that the Golgi is the site for eNOS palmitoylation                              .
PMC2064233	false	sec-8	28	171	Palmitoylation of substrates on the Golgi would stabilize protein association via kinetic trapping                     and allow for protein localization either on the Golgi or movement to the plasma membrane , as recently confirmed for Ras                     .
PMC2064233	false	sec-8	28	172	Supporting this are data showing that DHHC-9 , an H- and N-Ras PAT , colocalizes and interacts with GCP16 , which is a Golgi localized cosubunit                          that appears necessary for DHHC-9 activity toward Ras and movement of Ras to the plasma membrane .
PMC2064233	false	sec-8	29	173	For most dually acylated proteins , N myristoylation is a cotranslational modification that favors posttranslational cysteine palmitoylation .
PMC2064233	false	sec-8	29	174	For eNOS , mutation of the palmitoylation sites does not affect N myristoylation but blocks tight perinuclear targeting and NO release from cells                               .
PMC2064233	false	sec-8	29	175	The mistargeting and dysfunction of these mutants may reflect a structural change or lack of palmitoylation ; however , our RNAi experiments , which show that reduction in DHHC-21 decreases eNOS palmitoylation and impairs targeting , indicate that palmitoylation of eNOS is crucial for proper targeting and function .
